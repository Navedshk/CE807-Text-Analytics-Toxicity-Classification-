Sometimes, the regimes targeted all the land owners, secular and clerical.  Other times, they targeted just the Church.  The Church was not only targeted because it owned land but because they controlled all aspects of society (i.e. from marriage to baptism to last rites and burial on church grounds).  Secular reformers saw this as a stranglehold whereby the Church could get anything it wanted not just from owning land but by controlling who could marry, have a legitimate child or even ``die within the Church``.  The Church was also targeted because it tended to support the landowners in a conservative alliance.  Finally, the Church was targeted by a number of revolutionary regimes because it had supported the Spanish monarchy against the rebels.

606346819.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN*No Lists of top ten venomous snakes don't belong in ANY encyclopedia, including Wikipedia. These kinds of lists belong maybe in a children's book. Venom composition is not static. Even within a single individual, it will vary in quantity and relative proportions of components over time. Greater variability in components is seen between individuals of a species, greater still between species. Further, venom continues to evolve, often very rapidly, so there may be wide variations in venom composition and toxicity within a single species, over its geographic range. This is especially true for widely distributed species and may cause problems in antivenom effectiveness. Factors involved in the variation of venom and its toxicity include diet/habit variability, seasonal changes, geographical location, age-dependent variability, gender-dependent/sexual variability, altitude, and the list goes on. Then you've got the research methods used. This can be critical, as some snakes produce many venom components, but eject them sequentially, rather than as a uniform mixture. The immediate fate of the venom after collection is important, particularly in relation to environmental conditions that might denature certain components. The storage of the venom is also vital, and exposure to heat may cause damage to certain toxins. Prolonged storage in liquid form may damage others. Pooled venom may introduce many variabilities, because each pooled batch of venom will contain venom from different specimens, compounding both intra-individual and intra-specific variability. There are many potential variables in such research that may affect comparability and interpretation of results. The choice of test animal may be crucial, because each species may respond differently (including humans). The choice of route is also critical. The standard test of toxicity is the LD50. Mice are most commonly used. The LD50 remains the most universal standard for determining and comparing toxicity of venoms. As an example, the rough scaled snake (Tropidechis carinatus) has a much less potent venom than the tiger snake (Notechis scutatus), on LD50 testing in mice. Yet clinically, the two venoms are virtually identical in the type and severity of effects on envenomed humans. There are many examples just like this across all species. The black mamba is not the most venomous snake species in the world, but it untreated human moratality rates are 100% and produces death in the most rapid time. To compare, the many-banded krait has a more potent venom on mice, but doesn't produce the same devastating effects on humans the way the black mamba does. Many more examples are readily available. Mice aren't humans. Yes, they may give us an idea on toxicity, but they aren't the same as humans.  `  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?

I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.

132260720.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== ban or block? ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I understand it, a ban is something imposed on a user by the community appointed Arbcom or Jimbo Wales by fiat for whatever reason, and a block is something any admin does to an individual user account or IP address for predetermined reasons (usually vandalism, sometimes immediately if the vandalism is severe or offensive enough, or in the case of continued actions by users blatantly against policy in the face of multiple warnings). They can both be for a set time or permanent. Bans can be permanent, blocks of user accounts can be permanent, but we don't like to permablock IP addresses. As in the case of Jessica, I blocked (what I believe to be) her IPs for 6 mos., so it ever gets reassigned to another computer after that time that computer can conceivably register for a new user account. Known shared IPs are blocked for much less time. Admins are supposed to use Arbcom mandated block ranges to enforce bans, but don't themselves declare bans on other users in order to block or have other admins block. That way, admin actions can be reversed by other admins or even by themselves if they change their minds, but bans ``from above`` can't be lifted by admins.

266836400.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENLeejc is absolutely right. He did a better job expressing what I tried to say back in June, 2007. But while I agree with his final conclusion, it isn't quite the right argument to use, that ``we must assume the worst,`` to get it. So I thought I would try once again to explain how the different wordings of this problem, that seem to say the same thing, can lead to different solutions.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe ultimate cause of confusion is the math-specific definition of the term ``event.`` When a random experiment produces a result, that result is not called an ``event,`` it is an ``occurrence.`` ``Event`` is defined to be the subset of all possible occurrences that have some defining common property. So if I flip a coin a hundred times, there are only two possible events: ``heads`` and ``tails.`` There will most likely be about fifty occurrences of each event; and each occurrence will fit into only one event.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf I draw a card from a standard deck of playing cards, there are lots of possible events and/or occurrences. Some of them overlap. They include ``black card,`` ``spade,`` ``honor card (TJQKA),`` ``Ace,`` and ``Ace of Spades.`` The occurrence ``black card`` can be in the event ``spade`` or ``club`` as well. Note that an occurrence can fit into other events, but not vice versa. An occurrence of ``spade`` is also an occurrence of ``black card,`` but the event ``spade`` is most definitely not the event ``black card.`` Since determining probabilities involves counting the number of elements in events, the difference can be crucial when less specific observations are applied.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere is a famous problem that isolates this difference between an occurrence and an event. It is called Bertrand's Box Paradox Suppose you have three indistinguishable boxes, each with two indistinguishable drawers. Inside each drawer is a coin. Box #1 has two gold coins, Box #2 has two bronze coins (I can't resist the temptation to use the initials B and G), and Box #3 has one of each. You pick a box at random, and open a drawer at random. If the coin is gold, what are the odds that the coin in the box's other drawer is also gold (i.e., that it is Box #1)?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe first issue here, common to story problems, is that this problem describes an occurrence, not an event. We must extrapolate what the possible outcomes of the actions are, to define the event (the set of possible occurrences) that defines the conditional probability.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe incorrect approach to Bertrand's Box Paradox is to say that you narrowed the identity of the box to two possibilities, Box #1 and Box #3. That the ``event`` matches the observation ``the box has at least one gold coin.`` This is wrong because there are other ways to describe occurrences in that event. If you pick box #3, then no matter which drawer you open, the occurrence is in the event ``the box has at least one gold coin.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe correct approach is to define the event as the set of all possible occurrences where you open a drawer with a gold coin. Every possible occurrence that is consistent with the problem description is in this event (remember, it's a set), and every possible element of this event is consistent with the problem description. Both of those conditions have to be true for the event set we extrapolate as the condition. This set has three elements, not two. In two of those three possible occurrences, the box's other coin is gold. The correct answer is 2/3.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have seen a variation of Bertrand's Box Paradox used to represent the Boy or Girl Paradox. You are the organizer of a neighborhood swim meet. During the meet, you get a phone call from Mr. Smith, who is delayed and can't pick up his children after the meet. He says ``Tell my two kids to go home with a neighbor. Their names are Sarah and...`` and the phone connection goes dead. There are four families of two children in the meet, and they conveniently include the four possibilities BB, BG, GB, and GG. What are the odds that Mr. Smith has two daughters?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis occurrence can be described as ``a two-child family includes at least one girl.`` But not the event you need to use as the condition. Mr. Smith could have mentioned a boy's name first; and if that boy had a sister, that occurrence would have been an element of the set ``a two-child family includes at least one girl.`` So that event fails one of the two criteria. You get the answer 1/3 by erroneously using this event.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe correct event is just that Mr. Smith mentioned that he had a daughter, and compares to ``you opened a drawer with a gold coin`` in the Box Paradox. You can count four possible occurrences of that event. In two of those four, representing a single family, Sarah has a sister. The correct answer is 2/4, or 1/2.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf a conditional probability question describes an occurrence, and not an event, care needs to be taken whe  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

The title ``Israeli apartheid`` uses the 2nd meaning. This seems to favor the anti-Israel side. In the suggestion that started this thread  ``Comparisons between Israel and apartheid-era South Africa`` the word 'apartheid' has the 1st meaning. This arguably favors the pro-Israel side. But ``Israel and apartheid``?? Gee, one of the interesting things about ``Israel and apartheid`` is that the noun 'apartheid' is not modified (either by Israeli or SA).

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMade new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks. I'll leave it in for the moment and will try to remember to do backup research when I get home; if anyone believes that the information is unreliable enough please feel free to mark it out, and I'll just have to find a better source than word of mouth from my parents at the time ;)NEWLINE_TOKEN::Later: Researched.

As this reduces the channel floodwater capacity, the creek will over time seek new, lower paths, forming meanders (a curving sinuous path). The leftover higher locations, typically natural levees at the margins of the flood channel, will themselves be eroded by lateral stream erosion and from local rainfall and possibly wind transport if the climate is arid and does not support soil-holding grasses.

The two schools are brother and sister schools, and as per the History section in the HNMCS article, ``The Felician Sisters and St. Michael's College School co-founded the independent Holy Name of Mary College School``. As such, it is appropriate to contain some basic information about HNMCS in this article and in the same way, to include some basic information about SMCS in the Holy Name of Mary College School article. The inclusion of the school type (independent), gender (all-girls), and religious information (Catholic) of Holy Name of Mary College School in this article, is meant to illustrate the parallels to the school type (private), gender (all-boys), and religious information (Catholic) of St. Michael's College School.

I believe it should be removed as not necessary in an article about SMCS (and the same for St. Mike's info on the HNMCS wiki).  — Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe point of including this basic information is to show how Holy Name of Mary College School and St. Michael's College School are connected by virtue of their school type, single-gender, and religious affiliation. The inclusion of this basic information is included to illustrate the parallels between the two schools.  These parallels are part of the reason they are brother and sister schools, and therefore this information is relevant and should be included in the article.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThey are two separate institutions. If you want to write a paragraph describing the schools' connections, that can be done in sub-article within the main article. Readers can go to the other school's wiki for more detailed information and don't need to see it in the introduction, where it appears as self-serving PR. See Basic Navigation in Wikipedia  ``Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced. When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information elsewhere. Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead. The reader is always one click away from more information on any point that has a link attached.``http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo if understand correctly, the inclusion of a section on each wiki describing the links between the schools is an acceptable compromise in your view?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI only ask Mikeycanuck for clarification because it goes against his reasoning for removing the very basic information previously included in the introduction that drew the parallels between the two schools. In removing that content, Mikeycanuck commented (see View History), ``Removed superfluous information on Holy Name. Should be in HNM's wiki.``  So Mikeycanuck, you are adverse to very basic information included in the introduction, but you would welcome an entire paragraph within the article?  I want to ensure we have reached agreement before I go ahead and add that paragraph.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe detailed information does not belong in the introduction, which should always be concise and relevant. In a later section, a description of the school's links is acceptable, if it is relevant. If SMCS chose Holy Name as its ``sister school`` for certain reasons, and they are verifiable, I would not object. I am never opposed to compromise and reasonable discussion and discourse.

From the Black Book of Communism (Using the Julian calender): The October revolution was on October 25. The Communists started closing down independent newspaper and radio stations the day after (p. 54). On November 13, on order was sent out that all who were suspected being an ``enemy of the people`` should be imprisoned (p. 55). Starting in January 1918, war prisoners were being tortured and killed on a large scale (p. 60-61). Starting in May, food was being ``requisitioned`` from the peasants (p. 66). Also in May, several working-class demonstrations were bloodily suppressed (p. 68). There were around 110 peasants uprisings in July and August (p. 67). In June 1918, the Cheka already had 12,000 members (p. 68).  On the 9 and 10 of August, Lenin sent out telegrams ordering mass executions, deportations, and concentration camps. (p. 72-73). Trotsky also supported starting concentration camps (p. 63). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAfter the assassination attempt on Lenin and the succesful assassination of Cheka leader Moisei Uritsky on the same day, Lenin and the other Bolshevik leaders decided to respond with overwhelming force, both as retribution and as a deterrent for any similar future attempts. This led to the particularly intensive period of oppression called the Red Terror.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn May 1919, there were 16,000 people in labor camp based on the old Tsarist katorga labor camps, in September 1921 there were more than 70,000 (p. 80). There were large scale rapes of ``bourgeoisie women`` documented in 1920 (p. 105). In total, 50,000-200,000 summary executions of ``class enemies`` occurred during Lenin regime.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring Russian Civil War, Lenin started ``requisitioning`` supplies  from the peasantry for little or nothing in exchange. This led peasants to drastically reduce their crop production. In retaliation,  Lenin ordered the seizure of the food peasants had grown for their own subsistence and their seed grain. The Cheka and the army  began by shooting hostages, and ended by waging a second full-scale civil war against the peasantry. The food requisitioning are documented on p. 97 and p 120-121. The war on the peasantry, including the use of poison gas, death camps, and deportations are documented on p. 92-97 and p. 116-118. In 1920 Lenin ordered increased emphasis on the food requisitioning from the peasantry, at the same time that the Cheka gave detailed reports about the large scale famine (p. 121). The long war and a drought in 1921 also contributed to the famine. Finally, Lenin allowed relief organizations to bring aid but later had most of the Russian members organizing the aid liquidated. Foreign relief organizations suspended aid when it was revealed that the Soviet Union preferred to sell food abroad in order to get hard currency rather than feed its starving people. Estimates on the deaths from this famine are between 3 and 10 million. For comparison, the worst crop failure of late tsarist Russia, in 1892, caused 375,000 to 400,000 deaths .``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs can be seen, it is extremely well-referenced.

That, to me, is where the logical split is, in a number of ways. The 200/300 (including 350), went by ``Super King Air``, and while there's a lot of commonality between the 90 and 100, there's much less so between the 100 and 200 (the exception would be the 90F which borrowed the 200's tail, but I wouldn't worry about that). Plus, the PT-6A engine comes in two ``families``, the large PT6A and the small PT6A (# of PT wheels being a big factor). The 90/100 KAs use small PT6s, the 200/300 use large PT6s, so there's a natural split there. If we split the article there, each would have a fairly decent length, and could possibly be split further down the road if they continued to grow. Just some thoughts....  `  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

As a consequence, France has long had neither blasphemy laws nor sodomy laws (the latter being abolished in 1791). However, ``offenses against public decency`` (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à l'ordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution. With such emphasis on public order, laws sentencing racism, sexism or antisemitism are also old and important. For instance, laws prohibiting discriminatory speech in the press are as old as 1881.[93] Some consider however that hate speech laws in France are too broad or severe and damage freedom of speech.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis has to be removed, or at least re-written, because it is incorrect, and not supported by the source given.

A point source emits spherical waves, not plane waves.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn none of the references stated in the nonsensible Wikipedia article on the transverse Doppler effect, to which you have contributed, a proof is delivered, but it is simply asserted there that the transverse Doppler effect has been unknown in classical physics. In dozens of textbooks this nonsense is repeated without proof because authors tend to write off from one another.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN'Proofs' of the nonsense are delivered in Chapter 11 of J. D. Jackson's book on clsssical electrodynamics as well as in a German book on SRT by Greiner/Rafelski who probably have copied the 'deduction' offered in Jackson's book (who himself probably got that 'deduction' from somewhere else). These 'deductions' boil down to direct betrayal of naive students, because the students are made to believe that a point source, such as a fixed star, does emit plane waves rather than spherical waves. Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe nonsense of the 'non-existing classical Doppler effect' spreads in the literature since Einstein published in 1907 a short note, where he had stated that the transverse Doppler effect, which already Stark wanted to measure (why, if it is unknown in classical optics of moving bodies?), is ``important``, but not that it is ``unknown`` in classical physics.

Is it theoretically possible to feed a nation with meat that was grown 100% in a lab and not killed from any animal??  I had a thought that animals would benefit greatly from this.   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Um, you could grow either stem cells or non-stem cells in some sort of cell culture system for food, I guess, but it seems like a hideously expensive exercise & you would likely use animal or animal-derived products in their growth. The problem would still be the texture and the flavour''.NEWLINE_TOKEN::Realistically, it would be easier to feed everyone with soya flavoured to taste like meat. I've read that the entire underdeveloped world could be easily fed using the grain the US alone feeds its livestock (not sure if that's true though). Eating meat is costsly, and in vitro meat would be even moreso. The best way to save the animals would be to go vegetarian... but I still like a good steak.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::So you are saying there is never going to be an answer since taste and flavor can never be produced in a lab?  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Not never, just that I suspect that taste and flavour will be greater hurdles than growing cells.

My view is this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe evidence of direct anti-Romanian actions undertaken by the USSR in the 1920s is abundant. The convention of October 28, 1920, whereby the British Empire, France, Italy, and Japan recognized Romanian sovereignty in Bessarabia, was rejected as invalid by the USSR. Moscow even denied the validity of that part of the convention that stipulated that, upon Russian request, the Council of the League of Nations could be empowered to arbitrate the Russo-Romanian dispute over Bessarabia. In short, the Kremlin insisted that Romania was illegally occupying Bessarabia. And it was because of this intransigent attitude that the Soviet Union refused to make any concessions. Romania's attempts, in the early 1920s, to seek accommodation with the USSR on all issues except the Bessarabian fell on deaf ears as the Kremlin encouraged revolutionary activities by Bolshevik elements in Bessarabia. The establishment in October, 1924, of the Autonomous Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic as a focal point for eventual reincorporation of Bessarabia into the USSR indeed eliminated the possibility of peaceful resolution of Russo-Romanian differences.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe exact position of the USSR on these issues is unknown except for Moscow's unwillingness to make any concessions to Bucharest on Bessarabian issues. Recent tracts by Romanian historians have emphasized the support given by Romanian Communists to the ``democratic forces`` opposed to alteration of the status quo in Transylvania in 1938 and subsequent years. True as this may be, there has been no evidence presented in support of any fundamental change in Moscow's traditional anti-Romanian positions with respect to Bessarabia in 1938 and subsequent years.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhether the Kremlin envisaged this entire scenario in August, 1940, is uncertain. But that this possible scenario was within the realm of Russia's long-range plans for Romania and Eastern Europe cannot be doubted. The Romanians were aware of Russian intentions throughout the interwar period, and the Hungarians were also conscious of the potential advantages to be derived from Russia's anti-Romanian attitudes in an eventual resolution of the Transylvanian question. And it is undeniable that the Romanians and the Hungarians remain aware of Russia's interests in Transylvania forty years after the Vienna Diktat.`  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Justice is defintely a philosophical concept and so it is important to discuss the philosophical meanings and debates concerning justice, but it is also a political/judicial term as well as an everday term that people use and so it would be good to have all of this represented in the article eventually. I think stuff like this from the original article is very important: NEWLINE_TOKEN:In most cases what one regards as ``just`` (not necessarily meaning what is just) is determined by consulting established and agreeable principles, employing logic, or, natural law In specific systems justice is determined, by consulting a majority, or in social contexts where religion dominates, justice may be thought to require deference to religious texts or to spiritual guidance, under a monarchy or authoritarian state the ruler/s determined what was just and doled out justice. All of these determinants of justice have at times delivered particularlly dark periods of history where justice was seen to be absent. If a person lives under a specific set of laws in a country, concepts of ``justice`` are often simply deferential to the existing law —the issuing of punitive reprimands for violations may be referred to as ``serving justice.`` In principle, this fits the general concept in that the individuals get what is supposedly due to them. Justice however, is a universal and absolute concept; laws, principles, religion, etc., are merely attempts to codify the concept  occasionally with results that entirely contradict the true nature of justice.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso this paragraph:NEWLINE_TOKEN:''In some cases, justice is not e  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

The two policies followed parallel courses until March 1939.

More mention of the possibility that the narrative genre is disinformation is needed. The article should be explicitly clear that labeling an allegation a ``conspiracy theory`` is an attempt at dubiousness through association with the narrative genre. Also, ``generally and ``commonly considered`` in the intro are incomplete and need to be fixed for NPOV.

Germany is officially still called (FRG), the Federal Republic of Germany - it's the same country, with the same NOC since the first modern Games held in 1896 - only the GDR had a separate NOC, because it was a separate country (although not recognized by Germany). ``West Germany`` did never exist, and is nothing more than the common English name used for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::: (after ec) I do not understand your question as written, so I will simply explain UNDUE in a general way. Let's say, for example, we are writing about nails. An authoritative work about nails, written by an expert on nails, and used as a textbook, or source for a textbook about nails, would get a lot of weight - we would regard it as definitive. A differing view from a nail manufacturer's website would get considerably less weight, as would a newspaper article about nails. Finally, a politician or celebrity's comments about nails would get no weight at all, unless in their article, not the article on nails. And your cousin Bob's random comments on nails in his blog not only gets no weight, mentioning them on a talk page might be considered a violation of WP:FORUM. Giving a newspaper article the same weight as an authoritative text by an expert is a violation of UNDUE - you are giving a less important source undue weight. Applying this here, then medical texts on Abortion carry the most weight; other sources carry less and less weight the farther they move from authoritative sources.

It is not ``our place`` to accept or reject this information. Are there reliable sources anywhere that are arguing the man is not a pedophile? If that were the case, I can see why this would be up for debate. But it's not - nobody is claiming the man is not a pedophile. Additionally, before you argue that ``we don't know whether Watkins is sexually attracted to children,`` I highly suggest you actually take a look at the facts of the case and all the activities he has been involved. If you can't be bothered to do that because it sickens you, then fine, but don't claim that there's just no way for anyone to know.  😜 NEWLINE_TOKEN*`  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Being blocked is not the end of the world, and the fact that it ends in one week means you are being given a second chance. If you keep behaving this way, it's just going to escalate. No one is looking to silence you. Editing Wikipedia is a privilege, not a right, like driving a car: you'll keep getting warnings and tickets for bad behavior until your license is lifted. If you continue to break policy and tell people to ``fuck off`` your editing privileges will be revoked. Like real life, it is the way it works. Second, you were told exactly why you were blocked: you violated copyright and harassed the editor who removed the offending material. Did you read WP:COPYPASTE like I had suggested? It clearly states that copying text verbatim from other sources into Wikipedia articles is not allowed. It does not distinguish between works of fiction or non-fiction, therefore it holds for all available written content. Even if you don't agree that the edit was a copyright violation, you should not have reacted so hostilely. If you feel people aren't listening to your side, don't call them ``fascists.`` It is the same as calling someone a Nazi: it is childish and it will only make people cease to take you seriously.

Unfortunately, however, this is an example of exactly the kind of thing which Wikipedia does not do, and it conflicts with several of Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. You are clearly intending to use Wikipedia to host a page about a product to publicise it. Whether the motivation behind doing this is to increase profits of the company making that product or ``for the good cause of the women in India`` is irrelevant: Wikipedia is not for use to promote anything for any purpose. To put the same thing another way, the policy that Wikipedia is not for promotion applies just as much to promotion of good causes as it does to promotion of business interests. Trying to increase awareness of health issues in a population where there is widespread ignorance of those issues is no doubt a worthwhile thing to do, but it is not one of the things that Wikipedia does.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:You should also be aware that editing on behalf of a business or organisation to write about a subject in which that business or organisation has a direct interest is brings you into conflict with Wikipedia's conflict of interest guidelines. A Wikipedia article needs to be written from a neutral point of view, and if you are writing on behalf of someone else in order to publicise a subject they are involved with, it is likely that you will find it difficult or impossible to write from such a neutral point of view. (In fact, in this case it is clear that you do not even wish to write from a neutral point of view, since your declared aim is to portray the campaign as a good thing.)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``Stayfree India`` has used several Wikipedia accounts, which have been blocked from editing, because their only purpose was using Wikipedia to promote their cause. They have evidently approached you to edit on their behalf, to continue the attempt to promote their cause. Under Wikipedia's policy on  abuse of multiple accounts, if any account is used to make edits on behalf of a blocked editor, thereby helping the blocked editor to evade the block, the account used for such purposes can be blocked too, as it is being used to circumvent Wikipedia's policies. As I said at the beginning of this message, I have no doubt that you are acting in good faith, and that is why I have taken the time and trouble to explain to you what the issues are, rather than simply blocking your account. You are welcome to contribute to Wikipedia on other topics, where you do not have a conflict of interest, would not be helping to evade blocks on other accounts, and would not be promoting a cause. However, continuing to edit in ways which conflicts with Wikipedia's policies in those respects will not be acceptable.   `  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

I think it would be easier to read if you separated some of the bigger paragraphs into smaller paragraphs. Also, none of the information under ``Applications`` is cited. If this section wasn't written by you and you haven't found any evidence to support these statements, then it might be necessary to rewrite this section. Under references, ``Reference List`` is misspelled. Also, it would probably be best to integrate all sources under one reference section. If you could incorporate more images to this topic, that would also be helpful to see a visual representation relating the hologram to the holonomic brain theory.

326911523.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.

What do you guys think?:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA 2012 national telephone survey in English of a sample of 400 Iranian-Americans, commissioned by the Public Affairs Alliance of Iranian Americans and conducted by Zogby Research Services, asked the respondents what their religions were.  The responses broke down as follows: Muslim: 31%, ``No response``: 15%,  atheist/realist/humanist: 11%, agnostic: 8%, Baha’i: 7%, Jewish: 5%, Protestant: 5%, Roman Catholic: 2%, Zoroastrian: 2%, and ``Other``: 15%. The survey had a cooperation rate of 31.2%. The margin of error for the results was +/- 5 percentage points, with higher margins of error in sub-groups.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDue to the laws regarding apostasy in Islam, some Iranians do not claim Islam as their religion, but would in fear of persecution. The Central Committee for Ex-Muslims was founded by Iranian Ehsan Jami with an aim to support apostates and to bring forth the reality of women's rights violations in the religion. According to Harvard University professor Robert D. Putnam, the average Iranian is slightly less religious than the average American. Iranian-Americans are distancing themselves from Islam, having accepted the negative characteristics associated with the religion. This is due to Islam being imposed on the Iranians through war and invasion, equating to authoritarianism, brutality and corruption. In the novel, Social Movements in 20th Century Iran: Culture, Ideology, and Mobilizing Frameworks, author Stephen C. Poulson adds that Western ideas are making Iranians irreligious.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThere are religious and ethnolinguistic differences among the Muslim, Jewish, Baha'i, Zoroastrian, Christian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Assyrian groups.Nilou Mostofi, Who We Are: The Perplexity of Iranian-American Identity, The Sociological Quarterly (published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of the Midwest Sociological Society), Vol. 44, No. 4 (Autumn, 2003), pp. 681–703, p. 685 Calculating the percentage of Christian Iranian-Americans is difficult because most Iranian Christians are of Armenian or Assyrian origin and self-identify as such, rather than as Iranian.`  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Firstly I thought there wasn't really enough explanation of why it would be preferable to build a Space elevator. The economics section has info on costs and all, but this is rather brief and comes towards the end of the article, I would think that explaining the perceived necessity of such a device would be one of the first things to state.NEWLINE_TOKEN:There were some things about the specifics of the engineering which I think need a lot more explaining, for one, is it proposed that the cable be a single thick wire or many tiny thin ones? It seems to be talked about at various points as if it could be either, so I think that needs more clarity.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Something quite important that I don't think was addressed at all (or at-least I couldn't see it) was the issue of how exactly the cable (or the whole structure) actually gets up into space in the first place. Are we to assume that the cable will be towed up by a rocket or something? If not that, then how?NEWLINE_TOKEN:Several times in the article it is mentioned that the ``Counterweight``, could be an asteroid or a space station. But these two things are very different aren't they? I mean in terms of mass, an asteroid probably weighs millions if not billions of tons, whereas a manmade space stations would be only a few hundred or thousand tons (unless some gargantuan station is proposed). So how can these to things be comparable? And what kind of actual weights will be involved?NEWLINE_TOKEN:Finally the article doesn't give much information on how the climbers are proposed to move. It is mentioned further down that Magnetic levitation might be used, but is that the norm, is that what they all propose?

Sebowsky  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN==Taxonomic table==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSetting up the table has already caused one fair comment to be raised about what happens to the taxon Uniramia.  My visits to various sites on the Net has taught me that the situation about the higher classification of the arthropods is chaotic.  Valid arguments could be made for any of many of these schemes.  The disturbing thing is that many of these different schemes appear on ``dot edu`` where they are presented as a professor's gospel to his class.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've probably already left the impression that, right or wrong, I have a preference to the ITIS scheme, and by extension (since ITIS is focused on North America) looking at the ``Species 2000`` where applicable.  I tend to use these on a ``without prejudice`` basis that recognizes the difficulties inherent in having bureaucrats control the science.  This view treats ITIS as a reference point, and nothing more.  If a person B's particular scheme differs from ITIS in a defined way it is 1 generation removed from ITIS.  A similar situation applies if C's scheme differs in defined way from ITIS.  However, if C defines his scheme with reference to B's then he is 2 generations removed from the reference point.  String a few schemes in a row, and you begin to lose perspective on the subject.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCladists have a stated vision of some day being rid of Linnean ranks altogether.  Given the uncertainty that often arises from guessing whether a particular taxon is a class or an order, I can sympathize with that view.  But without ranks the cladist's tree sometimes lacks good climbing branches where you can place your feet as you go up.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think that if we can maintain some consistency in using the primary KPCOFGS rankings, we can have more flexibility with the secondary rankings.  There is already some degree of acceptance that in most cases only primary ranks will appear in what was the ``Placement`` list, and what is now the top part of the tables.  That doesn't mean that there can be no exceptions to this rule.  (Cf. Wikipedia:Ignore all rules)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo, to get back on topic, higher arthropod classification is confused!  But there remains that if we want anything about the subject on Wikipedia, we absolutely need to deal with the confusion.  Here then is where I see things as standing between phylum and class in the Arthropoda:  NEWLINE_TOKEN#The trilobites (not listed in ITIS) are a phylum with a single class, and that fact appears generally accepted - no problem.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``Generally accepted``? Granted, I'm no expert (I've read a book about trilobytes, is all), but a quick google on ``trilobite phylum`` got me lots of assertions that trilobites are part of arthropoda. And trying ``trilobyte classification`` got me a claim that there are eight classes of trilobytes. NEWLINE_TOKEN:Yes - were is it generally accepted? I was taught that trilobites were a class of Arthropods and my animal biology text from 1996 confirms this. Has something changed since my freshman year of college?   : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENII. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENUnder the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), ``[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding.`` ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer ``(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession.`` Id. at 8.1(a). NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIII.

It was you that made the issue of Ethnologue being a RS a big affair (as scripta manent - even in WP - all a reader has is to go up a few comments and see arrogant statements such as ``Until you can produce a reliable linguistic source that has conducted more recent linguistic surveys in northern Greece, then Ethnologue is the most recent, most reliable source.`` when there was no census in 1986 to begin with! The gall of some people is astounding: they've all become ``specialists`` when they can hardly follow the Greek literature - because if they did you would be (a) dismissing Ethnologue's 1986 crap outright and (b) quoting the V-PRC survey which is recent and despite an obvious flaw of assuming no pluri-lingual descent/ability is the most recent and extensive statistical country-wide survey of use/understanding of non-Greek languages and significant Greek dialects in Greece to-date. If you were a specialist you would know that the US SD's ``estimate`` is not the result of a survey (do you seriously believe that any type of similar survey by a foreign power into such a matter would have gone unnoticed and not being reported in the Greek media causing a diplomatic episode?) but the estimate based on visits to some parts of Macedonia (in Greece) of a certain diplomat (later to become infamous through a very public resignation) called Brady Keisling that single-handedly raised the profile of the issue in the SD's HR reports. If you were a specialist - instead of trying to guess numbers you would be giving the number of villages in which the language was spoken by at least some inhabitants according to the 1996 Euromosaic study (which your pal FPS has apparently read - but still has been unable to digest enough to add Arvanites in Thrace in his ``map``). Then again you could do worse - your other pal Jim62sch seriously believes that you could have a non-government sponsored census (mind you not survey) in Greece (actually I wonder in how many developed countries can anyone other than the government ``convince`` people to stay home and open their doors for census takers to visit).

GoingBatty was (and still is) not interested in  Brazilian Hip Hop unless he's a secret gangster rapper. Maybe after a hard day in the hood with his scout charges this scoutmaster relaxes by expressing himself through rap. Anyway I'm bored by him and a whole bunch of other editors - all of whom seem to be here either as incognito moralists, conservatives, protectors of childhood, nationalists, etc. I imagine that many of the neo-nazi groups are here also. Its my experience of right-wingers that on the whole they don't want you to know what they are up too. I remember an arts center open mic night which I was attending being infiltrated by five or six or them. It was a surreal situation because none of them were actually musicians - they pretended to be comedians which allowed them the right to attend and perform. The woman who ran the night and who had no idea of how the BNP (British National Party) worked had put one of them in charge. I emailed the arts center due to the fact that I knew some of the people who ran the open mic nights (including the woman who had been put in overall charge and had made the decision to put him in charge) and got an email back saying the open mic nights were for everyone regardless of their political views. A week or two later I received another email saying that the arts center had decided to separate the comedy from the music by having separate nights for both. I'm  not too sure why but I do know that at one of the open mic nights the leader of this small BNP cell had been put in charge and after one of the singers had finished (she was colored) he said something that was really strange. I can't say what because people who were there may be reading this but it was racist. About a hundred people witnessed and heard what he said and everyone just sat silently in shock not knowing how to react - after all he was in charge. Now that is power. When you can persuade others that your intent is one thing and then position yourself to impose your will or views upon those who believe your original lie - well that is political power. Its not even a right wing thing since many left wing leaders have used to same ploy. It is the nature of a dogmatic personality who is seeking power to follow such a course when faced with opposition to their dogma. Here's what happened after the torrent scene released the membership list of the BNP and I spotted that one of them was a town planning consultant employed by my local council. I sent an email to my council of course. Evidently my council believe that hiring a BNP member as a town planning consultant for one of the most highly diverse ethnic towns in England was fine because his racist views shouldn't affect his ability to provide good advice. lol NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKEN*Sicko.

There's no severely affected patients in that lot and they were only exercised modestly with regard to their illness status; the more sufferers push themselves the more aggravated symptoms and weakness should be.

Is this more than last year, or fewer than prior? What meaning does it have, if it has any at all? Russia still has a largely Soviet-era nuclear arsenal, ergo, most of its ballistic missiles are technically past the expiry date and RF has been supposed to DEcommission hundreds of missiles each year for the past 20 years or so (which is not to say it has been doing it!). Meanwhile, as far as is publicly known, it has been commissioning about half a dozen, or a dozen on a good year. Thus overall, its nuclear arsenal has steadily shrunk.

You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBut they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it.

NEWLINE_TOKEN:Ultimately, there is one fact that is not disputed - Captain Asseline flew the aircraft into a stall. This is a very bad thing for a pilot to do at any time, and a cardinal sin when done 30 ft above the ground. The evidence is clear – the plane was at alphamax (high angle of attack), at very low airspeed, and with engine set to idle. Asseline has nobody else to blame for putting the plane into such a dangerous configuration, he was in command. All the other distracting issues, eg. precise altitude, wearing a headset, engine lag in responding to throttle-up command, etc etc, are little more than red herrings because none of them excuse the fact that the plane stalled due to pilot error.NEWLINE_TOKEN:There is a lot of evidence in the official report (I haven’t been able to find a version translated into  English), it’s pretty clear what actually happened. Oh, and reference 3 is a bit dubious; full of wacky conspiracy theories with no evidence to back them up. I propose that the article needs a major overhaul, trimming a lot out of the disputed account and providing more information from the official report.     : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

13570767.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:The thing is, just because some nomenclature has a historical POV does not mean that it has a current POV.  For example, I can use the terms Holy Roman Empire, Thursday, or Queen Elizabeth II without implying that I believe that the empire was holy, or that I worship the Norse god of thunder, or that I recognize the authority of the British monarch.  (Interesting note about the Quakers in the Thursday article though: should we scrub Wikipedia of ``Thursday``?)  Regardless of the historical origins of the abbreviations BC and AD, they now mean little more than indicating the point at which the English-speaking world stops counting years backward and starts counting them forward.  Seriously, how many people read ``BC`` and think that the Messiahship of Jesus is being proclaimed?  Or that AD means they accept Jesus as Lord?  Construing BC and AD as statements of religious devotion may have been valid when the terms were first introduced, but to reject BC and AD now in the face of centuries of tradition and widespread usage seems to be justifiable only under two premises: either (1) that any term with historical origins in religious devotion carries an eternal POV taint and should be excised from Wikipedia, or (2) that the abbreviations still so strongly communicate religious meaning to the majority of users as to make the terminology indeed POV.  The first premise is itself POV (by singling out religion as an unacceptable originator of terminology), and thus should not justify rejecting BC/AD.  The second premise, though is where I think Slrubenstein and others are coming from (do correct me if I'm wrong).  If this premise can be validated, then the POV-ness of BC/AD is established, and use of these abbreviations should be abandoned throughout Wikipedia in favor of BCE/CE.  On the other hand, if BC/AD is shown not to convey religious meaning to the majority of Wikipedia users, then it should be the favored usage in most articles based on its familiarity to readers.  Perhaps another poll could be taken to address the simple yes/no question: Does modern usage of BC/AD convey a religious point of view to you?  Assuming a sufficiently representative response by Wikipedians, the results may be a better indication of how to resolve this controversy than simply asking for people's preferences between BC/AD and BCE/CE.  `  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

I guess the editing system should allow two versions of an article: the main one, with the information that was agreed by everyone (intersection of information) and another, longer one with all the possible information for that subject (union of information).

Reference 2 (NME) is a questionable source because it is full of personal opinions and bias. And reference 3 (New York Times) states that ``Paramore is loosely affiliated with the world of emo``. Is loose affiliation enough to place Paramore in the Emo genre? I'm going to be bold, and say no; this is probably going to start some edit war, but I'm removing the Emo genre from the page as per WP:QS. Without credible sources, I will hunt down sources which prove they are not of the Emo genre and place them on this talk page. And before anyone points at the Joshua Martin quote saying that it proves they're emo, that is a writer's personal opinion of what they think Paramore's music sounds like. It would be like saying... French toast is bread, but with icing sugar, and its less healthy; yet French toast and bread aren't the same thing. They may seem similar, and may have qualities of each other, but they don't taste, look, smell, or feel like each other... and in before ``French toast isn't Paramore``, it's an analogy...

Even among Christian ``believers``, the ratio is more than two to one in favor of Protestants. This is no suprise: of the 13 colonies, only one had a significant Catholic presence (Maryland). Today, of the 24% Catholics, most (about 12-14% of the country) are now Catholic hispanics, mostly in California, Texas, and Florida (probably more, with undocumented Mexicans). The remainder are mostly Irish and Italian Catholics, in the Northeastern cities. Likewise most Protestants in the country are segregated, and live in the South and Midwest. There is a religious segregation in the country that muddies the appreciation of the ``other``. Of the Protestant/Reformation movement, most are mainline or evangelical/born again/fundamentalist churches. Orthodox are not a Reformation faith, but Mormans and Pentacostals probably trace origins through the chaotic, developing Reformation movement. Of the 20% not now calling themselves Christian, most are agnostic (probably with mostly Protestant roots), but some are Muslim, Jewish, or have Asian-rooted faiths. The main things apparently affecting religious population size are: Mexican immigration (Catholic), mainline Protestant church attendance and birthrate (declining), conservative Protestant activism (increasing), intermarriage (tending toward dominant faith of partners or agnosticism, ergo all ``conservative`` churches, born-agains, opus dei, othodox jewry increasing). In sum, Roman Catholics may be a plurality denomination (24%) compared to next largest (Baptists), but a Christian faith/movement smaller in size by half than the Protestant/Reformation movement, and again, in historical context in America, not a surprise. -2 November 2005NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN`  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. In this case, I think it shows what I could scratch the surface with in about 10,000 words. Adding citations might bring it up to 12,000, but the ratios involved will always be subjective. I will never be able to get a million Jews to sign a statement that they are against Zionism, for instance, but based on the people I've talked to, I think that about 35% to 40% are.

I didn't put the original reference to the Front in the al-Qaeda article; I merely clarified it. There are a lot of groups in Islam that don't like the United States or Israel. I realize that its easier to combine many of these groups into a general idea when talking about them, but thinking of the larger International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders, which is really more of a movement, as the same thing as al Qaeda, is perhaps too much of a generalization. You could generalize the World Islamic Front as loose enough to be the same thing as the International Front for Jihad against the Jews and Crusaders except that the World Islamic Front only has Islamic members. That means that most of the people in Bush's ``against us`` category could not be part of the World Islamic Front.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::Your assertion that ``bin Laden certainly would have no part of such a front as you describe,`` is absolutely untrue. bin Laden isn't a racist.

Thanks, '' NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENgrant hill?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMagic is the best example of a Point-Forward.  He's the guy on the floor that could play all positions and still run the offense.  LeBron James, Grant Hill, Lamar Odom, Antoine Walker are all guys in the league that are point forwards.  Shawn Marion and Dirk Nowitzki could also be considered point-forwards.  Kevin Durant and Brandon Roy could develop into point-forwards.  It could be argued Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan had some point-forward skill, both of them running their teams during crunch time, although Jordan will be remembered as the ultimate swingman, which he clearly was, than as a point-forward which he was when he began his career and later became again with the Wizards.  Magic gave us ``showtime`` though, he made the position what it is.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDirk Nowitzki and Shawn Marion point forwards?

Certain centers have the offense go through them similar to point forwards.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDefine ``having the offense go through them`` for point centers...there are some great passing centers, who the offense moves through (Shaq, Bogut, Duncan), but I can't think of any center who regularly brings the ball up and runs the perimeter game, which is the essence of a point. Also, Magic should NOT be listed as a point forward.  He is a big point guard, and played as a big point guard. and guarded other point guards.    The Showtime Lakers has Michael Cooper, James Worthy, and Byron Scott starting at shooting guard and small forward, putting Magic at point guard.  Most other point forwards (particularly Pippen and anyone who would qualify in today's game) still have actual point guards on the floor with them, though the ball handling is reduced and they're often combo guards(think Ron Harper, Boobie Gibson, Delonte West).  So Magic is still a PG, despite his height, and not a point forward.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHidayet Türkoğlu played as point guard at 2008 playoffs.

According to some authors, they were also fleeing forced Islamization by the Turks in what is today Albania (Katsanis, 1994:1). So, some have estimated that, when the Ottomans conquered the whole Greek territory in the XV century, some 45% of it was populated by Albanians (Trudgill, 1975:6). Another wave of Albanian migrations took place during the Ottoman period, mainly in the XVIII century (Trudgill, 1975:6; Banfi, 1994:19). All these Albanians are the ancestors of modern-day Arbanites in Central and Southern Greece.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen the modern Greek state was formed, the Albanian-speaking population and its language were called Albanian .Bickford-Smith, 1993: 47; Embeirikos, 1994; Vakalopoulos, 1994:243-249). However, the policy of the new Greek state was to Hellenize all the non-Greek speaking Orthodox populations within its, then limited, territory as well as in the territories of Epirr, Macedonia, Thrace and Asia Minor still under Ottoman rule). As elsewhere in Europe, army and education were the most effective mechanisms of Hellenization, assisted by the judiciary system ready to denounce and punish all forms of behavior inconsistent with the state’s nationalist culture (Kitromilidis, 1990:38; Kollias, 1994).NEWLINE_TOKENcheck this:http://www.nationmaster.com/encyclopedia/Arvanitika or this http://www.traboini.com/al/public_02.html or ARVANITET By Irakli Kocollari Reviewed by Dr. Arben Kallamata NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf u are Arvanit than translate this,my grandpa used to sing it to me:Moj e bukura Moré, si të lash më s´të pashë, si të lash, si të lash, si të lash më s´të pashë...  rri o laman se sje Arvanit ti po ik e shkërdheu me gjith Grek!

I'm not trying to be snarky; it's an honest question, because you seem to have a few misunderstandings about the process here.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFirst, if you feel that anything in an article is inappropriate, whether it's the original text or a recent change, you can edit it. You don't have to ask me to ``reverse the changes``. There are still rules of editing etiquette that apply, such as not just ping-ponging changes back and forth (see WP:3RR), and being willing to discuss differences of opinion on talk pages like this. But no one owns the article - not me, not you; no one has veto power, except for administrators; and there's no reason to ask anyone in particular to make changes for you. It's not as if I wiped out your text forever: it's all in the article history, which is pretty easy to use.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSecond, WP articles are not to be written based on what you or anyone else may think are ``very logical reasons`` to support a theory. It is fine to explain a particular person's or group's point of view on the subject, pro or con, as long as it's attributed clearly; but the encyclopedia itself is not in the business of saying what makes sense, and the purpose of the talk pages is not to argue about whether a theory is correct. Debates that might be very productive in the pages of a scientific journal are less so in an encyclopedia. This is particularly important when the theory has not yet reached wide acceptance as a scientific consensus - and I don't think you're claiming that it has. That is why I don't think the link from, for instance, SIV was appropriate; by stating that argument in the voice of the encyclopedia itself, it made it sound as if most researchers agree that this is a likely explanation. Again, see Wikipedia:Neutral point of view - one of the absolutely crucial WP rules.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThird, on a more trivial note, it is basic WP etiquette to log in under your username before you make edits or comments (so people can see who is doing what); to use the standard ``~~~~`` signature for your comments; and, when responding to a specific paragraph on a talk page, to indent your response immediately below it with ``:`` rather than copying and pasting the previous comment elsewhere.`  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

I'm going to attempt an interlibrary loan to see if they're worth anything as nothing from them seems available online although a few papers in JSTOR and WILEY draw on data from them.  Could be a decent source.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::I actually did get to read through the ones listed above but none of these are truly ``great`` sources in my view for the entire topic.  My goal in looking through them was to mainly see if they used the term ``emphatic mood`` and if so whether they applied it as a means of conveying emphasis and further how they then referenced auxiliary do in this sense.  Aside from the usual issue of no one ever having fully bothered to create a decent consensus on mood as a category and within that a standardized naming scheme for moods, the biggest problem I have with most of these sources is that they seem to assume that non-do expressions of emphatic mood via emphasis of other elements is understood, yet none of them actually include such a statement asserting such.  Mulvey refers to such expression in addition to do via auxiliaries in general with examples of emphatic 'will', 'be' and a few others, all established by providing vocal emphasis to those elements.  Beard lists emphatic mood along with a slew of other functions conveyed via auxiliary verbs in general, but doesn't preclude the emphatic (nor any of the other things he's listed) from non-auxiliary expression.  Huddleston seems to infer the use of emphasis in conveying emphatic mood by referring to examples that include neither do nor other auxiliaries, but since he doesn't actually explicitly mark his examples for whatever he is referring to them doing (I suppose he thinks his observations are obvious in each), there's no concrete way of knowing precisely what he is pointing to.  Google turns up thousands of grammars, ESL primers, and language learning websites that all discuss the use of do in conveying the emphatic mood but again just seem to assume the reader knows that emphasis is the means while (when needed) do is the vehicle.  Their wording seems to again point to some presupposed awareness that stressing the desired element is how you convey the emphatic, usually showing examples with non-verbal elements and then other auxiliaries emphasized before stating that do-support comes into play when no other auxiliary is present.  They also provide zero sources so are worth little more than reference value.  `  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

BEFORE the first Spanird came to the Americas, they already had black blood and Asian blood in them!  This is why they are darker.  This is why on the paintings from the Colombua period they had yelolow hues, dark hair, curly hair and full lips.  Yeah, Isabella was red, but Spaniards were never one type of European to begin with.  On top of that, as the Moors got defeated (not actually kicked out of Spain altogether), more Europeans came into the mix and reintroduced whiteness.  NOW, the mulattoized peoples still remained as it is today, especially in Portugal, France and Italy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOnce the Spaniards came over here, mixing was let loose, UNLIKE the rule in the USA!  See, the US was operating on whiteness and a white 'purity' concept.  You guys were operating on being greedy and grabbing land and not knowing what to do with it.  You mixed with the natives and the Africans.  It is more than clear.  In fact, it is so clear that that is all you see.  Only after the US established itself as THE word power (and broke down Spain's empire.  How come they did not do it to France..?), THEN you people started trying to think of yourselves as white.  That only increased as you immigrated to the US and it broke your hearts when you found out that you were not white and landed in the ghetto.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you sad mixed people don't get it by now - AMerica does not settle for mixes or those who cry about being white, you are or you are not.  If you have noticed in US history and society in general, Spain and Portugal are hardly if ever mentioned in a context with Europe.  You ask the average American where Portugal is they can't tell you.  They may have heard of some people (usually black) calling themselves Portuguese, but have no idea where or what Portugal is.  Spain less so, but white is not associated with Spain.  Even Europe is hardly associated with Spain.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll of this BS about you guys being more pure than American whites is just that - BS.  People know that you are hispanic.  You don't - you can't fool anyone.  Only very few of you look like a 'no questions asked' white person.  I can understand your pain, since many Greeks and Italians are regarded (not exactly accepted) as white, even though clear non-European/African traits are visible.  I guess you would ask ``if they can be white, then why should I not be?``  Good question, but you people are not doubt mixed and recently.  Italians and Greeks may not have a direct black parent, but you can look at them and see that African beneath the surface.  Some African is on the surface more than the white is!

Just because things are not going well n ALL of those (so much land and resources) countries, you want to come to the US and get a free ride as whites?  It does not work as easily for you as it may work for others.  One, you ARE NOT coming from Europe, so there is no built-n perception of whiteness based on Europe alone.  Two, you are mixed!  You need to review the history of the US!  Once you do (the 20th century alone will do), you will see that you need not apply as white.  Only the absolute whitest (dying your hair blond or red does not fool anyone for your information) need apply.  You just can't come to a country and get a free ride.  You have ALL of Latin America, instead of making something out of that, you want to come here and try and be white.  No, no.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI still cannot believe how many Puerto-Ricans, Dominicans, Chileans, Argentines and so on truly believe themselves to be white.  I met a femle who thinks she is white.  I keep telling her it is only in her world because it is not in anyone elses.  Spain IS in Europe, but despite popular thought, not all Europeans are white.  You can do your best to lie about the Moors, lies about African savery in Latin America and lie that there was even race-mixing going on, it does not change history and biolgy.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlso, I was already well aware of the hispanic trick of calling white people Anglos, meaning ``your type of whites as opposed to my type`` which whites don't care about.  You are not seen as white, you are seen as hispanics.  This is why you are (along with Italians and other black mixed Europeans)quick to (try) and be 'racist'(renegade mulatto is more like it) against blacks, thinking that it pleased whites and that it somehow makes you feel white in your mind.

It occurred to me it might be in Wiki's interest  for someone to check out your edits occasionally. When I took you to task for your poor revert, you said you thought it was vandalism and said ``'Endways, thank you for the massage``. I commented that I'd save that comment for your RfA as well as the fact you revert as vandalism an edit which isn't vandalism. There were a couple of other to and fros, including you telling me to ``give you a brake``. I was maybe a bit slow in twigging that your first language may not be english, or maybe you have health considerations interfering wtih your writing, but if either is the case, that reinforces my belief that your edits might bear random examination in the best interests of Wikipedia.

First, the basis of the website is the VoteMatch quiz (I'll be adding a paragraph about that next weekend for the Notability discussion)  that is based on a Libertarian Party favorite called the Nolan Chart. Unlike the Nolan Chart, which is arranged as a [[push poll] to promote libertarianism, we arrange VoteMatch so that conservatives and liberals have the same number of ``yes`` answers. Furthermore, if you look at who OnTheIssues covers, it scrupulously includes liberals, conservatives, libertarians, greens, and far more right-leaning AND left-leaning candidates than the mainstream press does. FYI, I get incoming email accusing OnTheIssues of being left-leaning about as often as an accusation of being right-leaning. My response is always to challenge the write to find better coverage of right-leaning candidates on Fox News, or to find better coverage of left-leaning candidates on CNN  the mainstream media on BOTH sides cover their OWN candidates' issue stances less than OnTheIssues does!

In addition its dredged up from some time back when we were all wrapped over the knuckles then.

I have also had a look at your User page, which I found very interesting and would like to comment further on your Talk page in due course. To answer your point, I did see how to request an unblock, but as the block was only for 24 hours, and the ground had anyway been cut from under my feet by 's posting on the Administrator's Noticeboard which had garnered approval for the block. I also dislike complaining to Admins about other people's behaviour; it just seems a bit wet to me (and I don't do it myself).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN'''' Firstly; thank you for the link, which I would otherwise have missed.

However, in looking at the CNN article, I noticed that in the beginning (fourth paragraph down) the following statement appears: ``Among the general public, CNN has a more centrist perception.” The source for this proposition is FAIR, FAIR being a “progressive media criticism organization” whose “target invariably is bias on the right” . Needless to say, FAIR is not a reliable source. On the other hand, the academic literature (i.e., peer-reviewed, scholarly journals) is full of articles addressing CNN's bias. They have concluded that the public perceives CNN to have a liberal bias:NEWLINE_TOKEN::>Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, Harvard University, & Project for Excellence in Journalism, “The Invisible Primary – Invisible No Longer: A First Look at Coverage of the 2008 Presidential Campaign,” p. 32  (noting that “The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain fairing the worst (63% negative) and Romney fairing a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral.”) NEWLINE_TOKEN::>Jeffrey N. Weatherly, et al, “Perceptions of Political Bias in the Headlines of Two Major News Organizations,” Harvard International Journal of Press/Politics (2007) (12), 91 at p. 97 (finding that “Overall, participants . . . rated the headlines from CNN as significantly more liberal than those from FOX News. . . . CNN tilted more to the left than did FOX News. The conclusion that CNN’s headlines were perceived as more liberal than FOX News’, rather than FOX News’ headlines’ being perceived as more conservative than CNN’s, is supported by the finding that overall, the headlines from FOX News were rated slightly on the liberal side of neutral. If FOX News’ headlines had been perceived as biased toward the conservative viewpoint, then the overall ratings should have exceeded 50 percent.”) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe administrator who semi-protected this article knew, or was reckless in not knowing, that (1) FAIR is a blatently unreliable source, and - equally important - (2) actual,peer-reviewed studies suggest precisely the opposite of the proposition that CNN is perceived as ``centrist.`` Would you please help in removing the unreliably-sourced, and inconsistent-with-real-literature statement concerning CNN's perceived ``centrist`` position (it's semi-protected)? I would also like some help in getting the aforementioned articles detailing CNN's perceived liberal bias included in the CNN article. Thank you so much for your time.   `  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Therefore, the acceleration of the Earth is 1024 times smaller than the acceleration of the hammer, so if the hammer falls through 1 m, the Earth will move 10-24 m during the same time. Such short distances, which correspond to an energy of 100000 TeV, are not probed even by the most energetic particle accelerators! Let's now do another calculation. Suppose we're dropping the feather. The hammer, which is presumably on the ground, attracts the feather with its gravity. The additional acceleration of the feather is given by GM/r2, where M is the mass of the hammer and r is the distance from the feather to the hammer. This gives roughly 10-10 m/s2, which is much bigger than the effect suggested by the Anonymous.    : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

And, quite honestly, since I have a large number of FA, A-, and GA-class articles under my belt, most reviewers seem to agree as no one's ever challenged me on this particular point before.    : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

You had some interaction with IP  in connection with the Golan Heights  so accordingly, I am notifying you and Stifle of a matter that is of serious concern.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENI have reason to believe that this IP user is Nableezy trying to circumvent a topic ban imposed on him by Stifle. The ban forbids him from editing or commenting on the Golan Heights and all areas of Israel and its environs including cities, settlements and regions.NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENThe IP in question geolocates to Chicago  and the edit in question is consistent with Nableezy’s POV.  Prior to the instant edits, the IP never made any edits to the topic area and the first edit that he makes in the topic area is to The Golan Heights. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNableezy is also from Chicago as evidenced from his early Trait PageNEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENBut there is more. The subject IP also made edits to a hockey article involving players in the NHL. Nableezy has expressed more than a passing interest for this subject as evidenced by this NEWLINE_TOKEN NEWLINE_TOKENBut the similarities between the IP user and nableezy do not end there. The subject IP made this edit on a very technical subject involving circuitry and electronics.

So that issue is settled.  Given that, and given the fact that this usage also is common usage in Minnesota and in official publications by this state, it is not helpful to have people going into the articles themselves and changing wording from Minnesota State Highway x to some variant without the Minnesota attributive in the compound noun.  It appears like an atttempt to accomplish indirectly what the participants in the discussion (other than you) agreed should not be done in the title.

138532531.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou told me that I shouldn't write edits about general discussion on the talk pages of articles in Wikipedia. But this time it was different. Whereas last time you were talking about the talk pages of articles, this time we are talking about the talk pages of users. Whereas article talk pages were general and public, user talk pages were personal and private. They were different and very different from each other. I thought they were personal and private. I thought they were different and very different from each other. When you said that talk pages were not for general discussion, I thought you were just talking about the talk pages of articles, not the talk pages of users. Although general discussion wasn't allowed in the talk pages of articles, which were public, I thought they would be okay in the talk pages of users, which were personal and private. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part. That was one reason why I didn’t thought what you told me in the article talk page meant that I shouldn’t make the edits then in the talk pages of those users.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat I did in those edits was sending, telling, and giving messages and requests, not general discussion. I thought it wasn't general discussion. That was different, perhaps very different, from general discussion, or discussion of any sort. I thought it was different. Whereas discussion is two-way and consists of several people talking together, sending messages is, or can be, just one-way, involving and being done by just one person, or both. Whereas discussion needs or involves response or repliance, sending messages doesn't need or involve sending responses or replies. The user of the talk page doesn't need to write anything in response, I just wanted him to read it and do what it asked him to. The messages and requests sent were not general either. They were special and specific, sent for a special reason about a special subject in a special time and situation. Those were not general discussion also because they were done in the talk page of a user, not the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk. I thought that was a reason why they weren’t discussion. If it was done in the talk page of an article or the Reference Desk, it would probably be discussion because it was one person talking and dicussing about this to lots of other people and a group in Wikipedia and telling and encouraging them to tell and discuss about it with each other, in a public place. But it was done in the talk page of a user, it would be just sending and telling a message because it was just with one other person and telling and saying something personally and individually to him, one way, in a private place. I thought you would not mind me having general discussion in a personal and private part of Wikipedia, or at least not too much or as much as in a public part.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough you may think what I did in the user talk pages was very bad, it's not really that bad. I thought it was not really that bad, wrong, and serious, especially if it was just done once or only very rarely. That was one reason why I did and would have done those edits on the user talk pages. I didn't really know and understand how bad you would think it would be. I didn’t think it would be really that bad. I thought it would just either result in no response from you, another warning from you, or a block that is at least not indefinite. There were actually several reasons why it's not really that bad, or at least I thought it wasn't that bad. First, it would not have actually made any real difference or bad effect to Wikipedia or its general and public contents, facts, statements, and information, etc. It wasn't damage or disruption because it was adding information, not changing or removing information. It was added in a user talk page, a place for adding messages and not for containing facts about one specific topic. Second, it was done in the personal and private part of Wikipedia. It would be just the users of the talk pages themselves who would see, read, and look at those edits, or would just need to do so, and so you don't really even need to care or mind about it, at least not too much. Third, they probably would not mind or dislike those edits onto their talk pages, or they might even be glad to see them. Fourth, even if they didn't like having those edits being on their talk pages, they could simply delete and remove it, or perhaps also make a copy of it and place it somewhere else, or simply just ignore it. Fifth, if you don't like them you could simply go to my Special:Contributions and quickly delete all of those edits.

When I added the archival sources many months ago, they were approved by a Wikipedia editor.  Moreover not only were the archival references recently vandalized, but also the reference to my published article in Brief Chronicles, a peer-reviewed academic journal, was deleted.  These archival sources cannot be characterized as 'original research'.  As noted earlier on this page, Alan Nelson's book is merely a series of quotations from these same archival sources stitched together with a bit of commentary.  If my transcripts of these archival sources (readily available to everyone on my webpage) are 'original research' and thus to be banned under Wikipedia's policy, then so is Alan's book, for the same reason, namely that it's largely a series of quotations from archival sources.  And as stated earlier, Alan misinterprets these sources, thus generating factual errors.

And we cannot break this impasse because I am pretty sure that no one has taken a poll of what readers of wikipedia want to know about jodhpurs.  There is a place for a history section, but there already is a link to the Maharaja, so a lot of what you proposed probably needs to go there.  But for the ref, links to images are seldom accessed anyway,so footnoting is perfectly proper and in line with wikipedia's manual of style. If the actual images can uploaded to commons, then I think adding one good historical image to the article is useful, but otherwise, they are awkward in the text.  I also have no beef with clarifying that they aren't precisely breeches, as they go to the ankle, except that no one has yet provided a dictionary definition or either term.

38719176.0,"SDATA_7 :  `. Some just make things up as if it substitutes for the truth, and use ``mistakes`` as ``proof`` of being ``disruptive.`` But, very few actually can cite facts, inaccurate edits, nor bother to even think about checking sources cited. It is much easier to ``complain about Theodore7`` and to ``revert`` since following Wikipedia's principles about biting newcomers is an ``excuse`` since it ``does not exist`` and ``does not happen`` to any newcomer. And, if they mention it - they are ``using`` it since it doesn't exist, etc., etc. This is just one of the many problems Wikipedia newcomers face with such people. It is so much easier not to care about any subject, nor to check sources (as I do as a journalist) and to find inaccurate and unfactual materials while avoiding POV. But, to play games, to have personality conflicts as if they actually know the people they are writing to. They avoid resolving matters peacefully, but highly enjoy creating fights, building molehills into mountains, and love throwing out wild accusations. They don't ask - they assume - they immediately accuse, then complain loudly. They take everthing personally - all the while - not reading, checking sources, nor citing sources themselves on the subjects in question but adding plenty of their own POV that is not neutral, nor cited with sources. If sources run counter to their POV - then they use ruses to attempt to divert attention: and ask for RFCs on Wikipedia members who just got here, and request arbitration to resolve situations they have not even started to resolve on their own - yet claiming that they have tried. Perhaps, if some spend much more time actually checking sources, citing them, and making sure that the encylopedic materials are factual then, the ``revert wars`` by some who want to re-write history to fit their own personal views would end, and Wikipedia could be that much more successful. So, if one is to gather evidence - show just where my edits are vandalism - where? I'd like to see it. Show my edit summaries. Show my edits, and don't cite my early mistakes as ``proof`` of being ``disruptive`` since I'd like to see someone claim they do not make mistakes themselves. Oh, one more thing. When a person defends themselves - try not to dismiss it as a ``diatribe`` - but actually read it in context and take responsbility for one's own ``claims`` against the person - in this case, a new member of Wikipedia. I've had enough of my comments being taken out of context, then pasted onto RFC and arbitration sections - and used as ``proof`` of me being a bad person, and disruptive. I say different, and have the right to defend myself against what I consider to be a classic case of biting Wikipedia newcomers. I will take credit for my honest mistakes, but not for accusations that are false. My evidence are the comments, and retorts, and my edits - which, are cited, and soucred. Any arbitrator who wants to know more about my edits and comments can feel free to ask, or to view my comments IN CONTEXT and not TAKEN OOUT OF CONTEXT by some who are doing the constant ``complaining.`` I see no proof of any infactual edits on my part. And, my early mistakes are just that - mistakes that most newcomers to Wikipedia make. That does not justify, say your own comments Bunchofgrapes, and those of the other ``revert warriors`` - who, in my opinion, are ruining Wikipedia. So, I've made inquiries elsewhere to make sure that perhaps this comes to an end, and that my case can be used as an example of what happens - negatively - to newcomers who run up against those who signed the RFC, and asked for arbitration. My evidence is there - my work to this time, my edits, sourcing, and using the Talk Pages - which I do not abuse, but use to add comments relevant to the subject at hand`  : EDATA_7",test,-1,-1

Anyway, it's well known that science coverage is better than humanities. The problem with situation like this is that you have people who seen to operate from a scientific mindset editing articles that have to do with literature, theology, culture, and philosophy. Most wikipedia admins mis-apply scientific concepts and criteria and methods to articles that are not subject to those methods. For instance, you constantly see idiotic admins asking for ``reliable`` ``empirical`` sources for a claim about literature, or asking for ``reliable`` ``unbiased`` citations for some postmodern topic. Hahaha. Anyway for philosophy at least we have the stanford encyclopedia. Right now the best compendium of information for information about the contents of books is on Amazon. Too bad that a greedy corporation gets to own and capitalize on all that free information. Wikipedia can't handle that stuff because any books that aren't the taste of these Richard Dawkinite Asperberger I-Fucking-Love-Science types get deleted. Like the Law of One article. Some pointy headed basement nerd decides he doesn't like those books so they should be deleted. Nevermind that they meet all the wikipedia requirements... what counts is that the admin thinks the books are ``nonsense`` and that the 30+ notable and reliable sources are ``biased``. And you can't get justice because there are way more dumb admins than good ones, and what kind of person would volunteer for such a terrible job anyway? The only people who become admins are power tripping losers with small man syndrome, because those are the only kind of people who benefit from the job. They don't follow the rules as laid out in wikipedia guidelines and there is no court or system to keep them accountable. The admin rot goes all the way to the top, and admins will never justify their rulings according to policy. It's like having a legal system where judges are not required to explain a ruling in legal terms. They just hand out the ruling without explaining how the ruling follows from law, and then they cry about it when people point out that there is no logical way to get from the written laws to the stupid ruling they made. They cry harassment. They delete your criticisms from their page. They delete the evidence you present. You claim this asshole is competent; why did he selectively delete the evidence I presented on his talk page? He deleted the EVIDENCE. That's not incompetence, that's malicious, that's psychopathic.

In this I am reminded of Martin Bernal. His propositive theory, which however took up far more space than Sand dedicates to the Khazars, was almost self-evidently silly. But his analysis in volume 1 of the modern historiography of ancient Greece as that was influenced by racial theory, is still regarded as a tour de force. One doesn't throw the baby out with the barfwater. As to genetics, Sand himself deals with that pp.273ff., and in so far as RS reviews challenge him on this, they cannot be excluded, even if, it's just a personal view, many of those reviews are incompetent and show a lack of familiarity with the book.

I'm glad this page is finally starting to look like the others of its type found on Wikipedia.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIn regards to ``unsourced and ridiculous awards``, I have sources for them, as you will see below, and they're not ridiculous.  For example, Meryl Streep's page has her NOMINATED for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for The Iron Lady.  This means she ranked in one of the top 5-10 slots for said award, though she didn't win the award itself.  If you peruse her awards section, you will find many critics circle awards she did not win, but was ``nominated`` for and the same applies to these awards.  This is common not just on Ms. Streep's page, but on other actors/actresses pages as well.  Nonetheless, I've made a compromise by removing Ms. Lange's actual rankings and replacing them ``Nominated`` as per Ms. Streep's and others' pages.

It appears that several arbs have asked for another proposal to be put forward, which I have done at Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Workshop#Editing_restrictions_proposal; I don't know if they are aware of this proposal or not. I have another issue, that being my indef block which was put on myself for a perceived legal threat. This has been mentioned at Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration/Requests/Case/Eastern_European_mailing_list/Proposed_decision#On_Russavia, and it has also been mentioned there and on the proposed decision case page, that WP:NLT should be dealt with as per that policy. I have dealt with on the PD talk page, and also on my talk page at , as per WP:NLT. It should be mentioned that my indef block was not as a result of any arbcom enforcement, nor as a result of a community supported ban, but as a result of the perceived legal threat. The indef ban was lifted so that I could participate in the Arbcom proceedings, but at that stage WP:NLT had not been dealt with to the satisfication of the blocking admin.? Anyway, I would like to seek some clarification from you at the clerk for this case, as to what I would need to do in order to have the indef block ``officially`` lifted, so to speak, so that I can return to editing within the confines of the topic ban handed down by Sandstein. Your advice is appreciated.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:Given the Committee didn't pass that temporary injunction, I'd suggest that you are still under the restrictions set down as part of the unblock-to-participate-in-the-RfAr. When the case closes, I expect the Committee will deal with your blocking/unblocking in some way in the final decision; depending on what the final decision is in this regard (there are an infinite number of possibilities), you/we can re-evaluate the best course of action at that point. NEWLINE_TOKEN:The only way to have the conditions on the unblock lifted before the final decision would be to appeal to the Community and get consensus to overturn the block; I doubt that this would be successful given the parallel arbitration proceedings, as most Wikipedians will likely say ``just see what ArbCom decides then play it from there``.NEWLINE_TOKEN:My $0.02. Regards,   NEWLINE_TOKEN::Thanks for your reply Daniel, its appreciated. As you can understand I am in a state of purgatory at the moment, not really knowing what may come, and whether the committee will indeed address this, as several arbs have already stated their opinion that cases of WP:NLT should be addressed by the community. Given that WP:DIGWUREN took some 3 months to reach a conclusion, and other cases can take longer, I would hate for this case to take that long only for committee to turn my indef block back to the community. As I am a content creation driven editor, you can probably understand that this is less like purgatory, and more like hell. Do you think it may be possible to seek clarification from the Committee if the issue of my indef block for WP:NLT will be dealt with by them, or not? If not, I would expect this would free me up to take the issue to the community via an avenue such as WP:AN in order to allow me to continue editing, under the confines of the topic ban imposed by another admin, with that perhaps being addressed by Arbcom (the topic ban). Sorry for being a pain in the arse, but hopefully you understand my predicament and hence why I think it would need clarification from the Committee, as to whether it will or won't be addressed. As you are the clerk, might you be so kind as to seek clarification for me, if you don't mind of course. Also, my apologies for bringing this to your talk page, as I am totally new to Arbcom proceedings (hoping this will be my one and only involvement in one), I am somewhat bamboozled at to where to ask for clarification on the case pages; it is a dog's breakfast that is for sure.

However, that hadn't happen, and the role of the Western allies was minimal in that. In addition, as some scholars believe, the Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan) lesson was duly learnt by the IJA staff.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMinimal? Stalin loved the oil embargo that Roosevelt put in Japan. It could have been this very factor that saved his neck. The Japanese were a military government, and both the Army and Navy did put pressure for their attacks. The attack in the in the Pacific was purely desesperation. If Roosevelt didn't mather with the Soviets, it was just question to give the Japanese their oil and good will to put them against Stalin. However at this time the US was already allied with the Soviet cause. And I don't remember were I read now, but the US embassador even treath the Japanese embassador in a conversation if they launched an attack against the USSR.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAbout Nomonhan, the IJA staff learned some serious lessons on how to FIGHT the Soviets with it. The Army never give up of the idea of attack the USSR. Even the Navy had some simpaty for the cause if it's advance in the Pacific would not be halted. War between the two countries was probably inevitable. Get rid of the Communist treat was one of the largest security problems for Japan. Matsuoka's secretary comments this in the World at War Banzai episodie. He said: ``But when an integration against the north parted [oil] the Army naturally joined up with the Navy``.

That's what James says, but what he is getting at, is praise for Ashbery, rather than the negative that was suggested above by Sighrik: that Ashbery could have produced more great stuff if he had not been so converted by the industry. I would say that this is an important piece of criticism on Ashbery, to the extent that those who consider themselves to be working outside the industry (oddly, this includes many university professors) have come to view Ashbery as something less than the real thing, or that he became part of the established industry because he was not a true innovator.

I replaced in the place I found it the actual picture of him posing in front of the stacked bodies at what I am sure was Buchenwald, and Anne-Marie von Hueber – de Grazia said that he had also been to Auschwitz. I did not know this until she made the statement on Facebook in connection with the photo. My father tended to self-aggrandizement and liked Jews who he thought were very smart. He also tended to be a Sophist, or sophistical. He could have written a lot with intent, or purposively. But still, why are you choosing this man, who did so much for humanity, as any sort of model for any sort of behavior that you might find unfavorable to your interests? The Nazis made their own bed and dragged the German people into it. The bombing of cities had already begun in WWI with German Zeppelins hitting London. The British chose to be the first to bomb German cities in WWII, but it would have started with German bombers in due time. I wandered the battlefields of Europe for years, just feeling the pain and division; even in my own mind and family, and grew up with young men and women who had lost their parents in the War, years before. Find someone else to pillory. Al de Grazia should be left in peace; he did his duty and it was rough from the start. He accomplished miracles considering all. Wikipedia is not good for you or your cause; it is filled with crap that anyone with a brain can see is made up to suit the authors’ purposes.

It is trivial and unnoteworthy because, as is explained in Wikipedia:Manual of Style (writing about fiction), it explicitly says that ``Throwaway comments and jokes`` are not to be used in articles.  The Creationist thing is clearly a throwaway joke as it makes no other appearances in the same context anywhere else in the series.  Not only that, but it is not even spoken orally, just written down on a piece of cardboard.  On the talk page, someone said that it would be easier to believe me if I were deleting the entire IQ statement, but the retardation itself is not trivial or throwaway.  It returns in To Live and Die in Dixie.  This makes it a recurring theme, a la Brian's novel and Ernie the Giant Chicken.  If the creationist joke were to return in the same context elsewhere in the show, THEN it would be noteworthy.  Wikipedia is not an indiscriminate source of information.  Just because something is true doesn't mean it belongs.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis whole block is founded of the misconception that I'm only deleting it because I'm offended by it.  Supposedly, this is because I called the term ``offensive,`` but I'll have you know that I'm actually a creationary-evolutionist, which is different from a creationist.
