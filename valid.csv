NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Character bios ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is of my opinion that the short character bios preceeding the main characters' character descriptions are more than trivial information than what we really need to have in the article. Also, it's not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia (I've seen at least), so I am going to go ahead and delete them.  (|) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI have just added the Zuka Club to the 'supporting characters' section; I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge. I'm not so good with adding pictures - especially when I have none - or Japanese kanji. Is there anyone who can add these?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Well, I added the clubs section and a pic for each club, and I'll get to the kanji for Zuka next.  (|) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:: Cool. Nice choice of pictures.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the 'supporting characters' section. Do you guys think it's too much ...?

(|) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::They should be visible in the fansub of episode 19; there's a scene of Ranka and Kotoko (Haruhi inside) when Ranka is having a flashback. I can't read kanji myself, but the translation for the caption text said that's what it says.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN== Japanese Title ==NEWLINE_TOKENWhile glancing through the edit history, I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages.  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn't involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow, I'm not all that fluent in the language, but I've seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I'm not aware of?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I've since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga's titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn't normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::I'll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|) NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::Yes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, 'bu' would be the  : EDATA_7",dev,0

Wikipedia is not the answer.  Wikipedia has writers and administrators who squash the truth.   They are anti libertarian and they glorify totalitarianism with their Nazi-style behavior.  Wikipedia’s lies are so infamous that it has inspired a nationwide boycott, especially for the apparent Neo-Nazism of some of its more rabid writers.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia writers prevent any mention of the new historical discovery that the USA was the source of the Nazi salute. The USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the ``ancient Roman salute`` is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text ``military salute became the Nazi salute.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFrancis Bellamy (author of the ``Pledge of Allegiance``) and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel ``Looking Backward``) and Charles Bellamy (author of ``A Moment of Madness``) were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the ``Nationalism`` movement in the USA, the ``Nationalist`` magazine, the ``Nationalist Educational Association,`` and their dogma of ``military socialism,`` and Edward inspired the ``Nationalist Party`` (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. ``Nazi`` means ``National Socialist German Workers' Party.`` A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent ``S`` letters for their ``socialism.``  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized ``S`` letter for ``socialist`` and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. ``  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a ``swastika.``  German National Socialists did not use the word ``swastika,`` but called their symbol a ``Hakenkreuz.``  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENRecently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the ``Roman salute`` article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry's discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Wikipedia article for the ``Roman salute`` used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: ``The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.`` Wikipedia liars also used the painting ``The Oath of the Horatii`` as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSimilar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer ``public schools`` when they mean ``government schools`` and they both cover-up the Bellamys' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called ``military socialism``) within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSome regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of   : EDATA_7",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.

They are based on reasonable material, but they contain a number of evident misinterpretations and have more of a school essay feel to them.

284072391.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlright, we've witnessed an administrative demonstration of power as with the ``protection`` of the article; thanks Bundy, for your kind warning. Can we now constructively return to the matter in hand? After all, it is the task of all of us Wikipedians to see to it that articles contained in this Free Encyclopedia adhere to encyclopedical standards and not those of the yellow press, isn't it? 'Free' should not stand for 'free of correct facts', 'free of truth(fulness)' or for that matter 'free of ethical restraints'. One would think we all, at least those of good will among us, agree on that. Now it happens to be the case, if not by willful disruptive tendentious editing then by negligence, that in its current state the article Francesco Carotta is full of errors of all sorts and easily verifiably so, some of which were mentioned in the previous, now ``deleted`` comment. Especially the section on the ``Dutch media controversy`` is a complete distortion of the real events, for instance, the review of Peter Veldhuisen was not related at all to the activities and pronouncements of van Hooff. This section needs a thorough revision, or maybe the best thing to do would be to just delete it, since it does not provide any information on the theory and might be of interest only to the yellow press. Furthermore, we the Populares, the People's Front of Rome so to speak, hope that it is not considered a personal attack if we dare to ask the reputable user Rubenstein what exactly he thinks it is that qualifies him to act as the expert for and supervisor over this particular article. If  does not deem us worthy of an answer, as has been the case a few times on this page, maybe other editors or just readers could try to help us understand. In any case, we fail to see why Slrubenstein's arbitrary words and deeds should carry any special weight for the decent normal Wikipedians. We also don't understand why there seems to be so little opposition to what appears to be his self-arrogated authority.NEWLINE_TOKENSo in closing we ask an unbiased and honest administrator—there certainly must be one around here—to remove the editing protection from the article so that some much needed reasonable work can be done by knowledgeable and sincere editors. In order to prevent tedious unfruitful edit wars we suggest to discuss changes to the article on this talk page first. —   `  : EDATA_7",dev,0

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::As I mentioned above, I rarely visit the arbcom IRC channel (which itself is not heavily used even by members of the ArbCom); swearing it off is largely a meaningless act.  I could readily stop participating in the mailing list, because I would essentially get the same information via other channels.  You seem to think that this is the only backchannel that exists or that I participate in.  It's not.  It's not even the most important one.  For me to accede to the spirit of your demand would require that, inter alia, I cut myself off from personal communication with people like James and Kat  people I count as friends  because they would likely continue to discuss the same issues with me that we currently discuss from time to time on the arbcom list; my opinions would still enter the discussion, just not as directly.  Furthermore, one of the major resources I use for collaboration with the Foundation, and specifically with Danny and Brad  which, by necessity is a wholly private resource  includes James and Kat as regular participants.  Withdrawing from that particular resource would hamper my ability to provide assistance to Brad and Danny, which represents probably the bulk of what I do on the English Wikipedia these days, and the part that I find most fulfilling.  I also frequently participate in ``backchannel`` conversation with Kat, James, Dmcdevit (another arbitrator), and occasionally smoddy on the restricted IRC admins channel.  Should I also withdraw from that channel?  It seems that the you and Geogre, through your joint demand, are seeking to require that I isolate myself totally from the entire ArbCom (Geogre's proposal even requires that I even refrain from public communication with members of the ArbCom; I don't recall if yours does, although I believe it does not).  Those people, some of them, at least, are my friends.  For you to ask such a thing is really quite heartless.  It would be akin to my demanding that you have no nonpublic contact with the myriad of friends you have no doubt made on Wikipedia.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::::::So, you must forgive me: I would rather resign my privileges with honor than accept either of the alternatives left to me:  giving you a hollow victory gained through my unethical manipulation of your own ignorance, or the personal harm of agreeing to cut myself off from those I count as friends.

I don't think vegetarians primarily eat plants or that it's synonymous with herbivore. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, honey, and yogurt, are not plants. Even plant parts is a bit of a stretch. Is flour a plant? My understanding is that vegetarians do not eat meat.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:It looks like an accurate description to me. Nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, beans, and flour all come from plants - I don't think it's necessary to eat the whole plant to be considered to be eating plants. Plants aren't even mentioned in the first sentences of the article.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:I see that mention of plants has recently been removed. The word vegetarian obviously indicates a plant-based diet.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::A nut may come from a tree, but it is not a plant. See dictionary. Yogurt is not a plant. Honey is not a plant. Fruit is not a plant. You seem to be confusing the meaning of words, which is problematic for someone working on an encyclopedia.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:::I think you'll find that trees are plants. Foods that come from plants are plant-based foods. It isn't rocket science.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::The article seems have been clarified which is helpful. Clearly there is a difference between a herbivore (a moose or cow for example) and a vegetarian that eats plant based foods like nuts, fruit and sometimes non-plant based foods dairy. Cheers.   NEWLINE_TOKEN:I removed a newly-added sentence in the intro saying ``Some vegetarians eat eggs and fish`` because the very next sentence says exactly the same thing.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I removed ``focusing on plant-based foods``, since a diet of solely dairy products and eggs, while unhealthy, would technically be vegetarian. Simply put, not all vegetarian diets ``focus`` on plant-based foods. As per the citations, vegetarianism is really just defined by what it excludes, not what it includes. -  NEWLINE_TOKEN::It would only be true of certain forms of vegetarianism, so the plant-based nature of the diet needs to be included.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::What about fungi? They aren't plants are they?   NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Fungi are fungi, not plants. Sigh... vegetarians... '' ↔ NEWLINE_TOKEN:::::Correct, they are not plants. Just in case anyone is still confused: nuts, fruits, seeds, tubers, sprouts, beans, and flour are all plant-based foods; they come from plants. Honey, yogurt, other dairy products, and eggs are animal-based foods; mushrooms and yeast are fungus-based foods; and algae (including edible seaweed like kelp) are none of the above. Also for the record, I'm vegetarian. -  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::(response to Michig) I don't understand your logic here. If some vegetarian diets do not focus on plant-based foods, then would it not be inaccurate to make the blanket statement ``vegetarian diets focus on plant-based foods``? -  NEWLINE_TOKEN::::Can you seriously imagine a vegetarian diet without plant-based foods? The lede should summarize the article, and if you read the article it discusses plant-based foods all the way through it. The Vegetarian Society's definition: ``We define a vegetarian as someone living on a diet of grains, pulses, nuts, seeds, vegetables and fruits, with or without the use of dairy products and eggs. A vegetarian does not eat any meat, poultry, game, fish, shellfish or crustacea, or slaughter by-products.`` Doesn't that sound very plant-based to you? The plant-based foods are the fundamental part of the diet, with some'' types of vegetarians also adding dairy and eggs.

I am normally much more than civil. I have often been complemented on my diplomacy and tact, but this user's approach to editing seems overly aggressive and not helpful enough. It seems to me that Verbal is abusing his position. Let me give a simple example. There were many edits made to the page in question with much valid data. Verbal simply deleted them with the cryptic note about them being non-notable (nn), or RS (or similar). This does nothing to help those who were attempting to improve the page. There is a term for this kind of bullying when one in the know smacks down new users without giving appropriate guidance. On the page in question. There were dozens of books listed with ISBN numbers. Is that not verifiable enough? If that is inappropriate, what is the 'proper' way to cite books? At the very least his reverts are ham-handed and trashed many valid and verifiable items along with a few that were unverified. How is that helpful? Verbal's standard seems to be if the reference includes a link to another existing Wikipedia page, then it is acceptable. Some of those pages are not sufficiently verifiable themselves. Given Verbal's aggressive approach, why not delete those other pages for lack of verifiability as well? I appreciate your guidance and assistance. I will do my best to bring the deleted content up to the standards once I understand them and once I have a contact like yourself to help keep an eye on Verbal who refused to respond to my previous inquiries. I will use my logged in credentials when I feel I am safe from being abused by Verbal's overly aggressive approach. I do not want to lose my account. He refuses to help or answer valid questions. He simply deletes entries with terse edit summaries. He's not helpful in teaching newer users what he is seeking. That's not what I understood was the helpful nature of the Wikipedia community. Look at all the credentials on his page. It's quite clear that he's an ego maniac. The more credentials, the lower the self-esteem, IMO.  I question whether all of those credentials are even valid. Are they subject to any verification process? Would there be any censure if he were found to be overstating his resume? Thanks for letting me vent.

99441035.0,"SDATA_7 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think you should differentiate between the mechanism of evolution and the historical evolution. On the one hand not only the basic mechanisms of evolution (variation by mutation, natural selection...), but also the whole mechanism of evolution can be observed. Not nearly as easily as gravity, but it can be observed. (Maybe here the example of antibiotic resistance would be a better, more verifiable example than the fruit flies) Still the mechanism of evolution is only a theory explaining observations which were intuitively called 'evolution'. Those observations are facts (here you got evolution as a fact). The explanation by the mechanisms of evolution is not. It is a theory by definition. On the other hand the theory of historical evolution explaining the variety of species can't be observed, because it is supposed to have happened in the past. You can only observe Fossils and the current flora and fauna. Then you can try to explain how all this came into being; for example by assuming a random abiogenesis of a single cell and then applying the mechanism of evolution. This random abiogenesis and the following evolution over millions of years is what a layman thinks of as 'evolution'. This certainly is 'only' a theory. It isn't and never will be a fact. It is very importent to clearly differentiate these things. Strictly speaking even the assumption that everything always falls downwards cannot be considered a fact. How can you know that there will never be a stone being observed falling upwards?? This may seem a bit like I'm splitting hairs, but if you don't strictly apply well defined terms of 'fact' and 'theory' you will end where we where a few centuries ago considering it a fact that we live on a flat earth. Don't ever hesitate to present things very differentiated! Maybe referencing the critical rationalism by Karl Popper would be a good idea, too.    : EDATA_7",dev,0

There is no vandalism involved and to be honest it is arrogant and totalitarian to just lock the page under false pretenses because you disagree with people's philosophy. The reason that people have started shunning Wikipedia is exactly attitudes like that to prevent a free flow of facts. If someone had written about the opinions of the faculty that Bell left the deanship at Oregon Law School because he was going to be fired since he spend all the time lecturing away from the school, I could understand that. But there are articles about his antisemitism. Bell's page does not even include his racist comments about Clarence Thomas, ``The choice of Clarence Thomas replicates the slave masters' practice of elevating slaves willing to mimic the masters' views.`` Also, Prioryman, name calling people you disagree with ``dunderheads`` really diminishes Wikipedia and perpetuates the impression that most administrators are bigots.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe user not only did not have the courtesy of replying to my comment, but deleted it.  I posted the following later:NEWLINE_TOKEN9 March 2012 (UTC)Dear HJ, do you represent the Wikipedia censorship brigade? I do not usually engage in conversations here so please let me know what I did wrong and you deleted my comment that there are NYT article's about Bell's antisemitism, as well as questioning why you locked the page since Bell is DEAD. I am a simple person, the type of people that Wikipedia was supposed to inspire to all contribute but totalitarian behavior like the one yo have exhibited both at Bell's page and here are what sours people with Wikipedia. Is not it bigoted behavior for Prioryman to call people that have opposing views ``dunderheads``? I am sorry but ypur behavior, as well as prioryman's, along with your sarcastic tone in history is what diminishes Wikipedia and makes you equal to the totalitarian freepers. The facts are the facts.

I may have been naive and thought that senior members in Wikipedia have these talk pages to discuss the issues. I was not trying to harass or attack anyone.  To the contrary, I have been totally respectful of everybody. However, if the behavior that I encountered today is the typical behavior of the administrators/senior staff, then it is really sad that this great endeavor has degenerated to  a site where only political correct speech is allowed. Or it may be because HJ lives in England where free speech is not allowed. As Americans, that's one of our liberties that is cherished and should be defended. Free speech is what makes us different from Europe and has allowed intellectual thinking and academic research to flourish, instead of remaining stagnant as it happens in Europe.  I am really surprised by this whole behavior. Is this high school, or what? We are all adults and we should engage in conversation, not call mom when we do not like something.

Please consider reducing the number of questions you've asked. I can see a way to turn it into six questions by combining several of them (13+14+15) and scrapping two (18 as largely duplicitive to general question 2, and 12 as not having to do with ArbCom).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPlease consider it.   `  : EDATA_7",dev,0

222530893.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word ``vandalism`` is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a ``content dispute``, since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is ``winning`` or ``losing``. What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:NEWLINE_TOKEN:#After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. NEWLINE_TOKEN:#I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as ``vandals``, this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.NEWLINE_TOKEN:#Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.NEWLINE_TOKEN:#Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.NEWLINE_TOKEN:#I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.NEWLINE_TOKEN:I hope all that I have said is helpful.

581897455.0,"SDATA_7 :  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDear few wiki editors who claim now to own wikiNEWLINE_TOKENWhen these things become personal they can become petty. I don’t believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being. Wiki doesn’t work that way. Neither do computers. You might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships. But you’ll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isn’t entirely your own. Unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations.NEWLINE_TOKENI was informed of the recent spate of death threats against Sharmila via a Mumbai Activist who received a message from a Manipuri who didn’t want to be named. I asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the Authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do. What the Nazis told the Jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them, that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens. Even the memory of their existence would be expunged. Yes in that I am comparing you to a bunch of Nazis. I don’t know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it.NEWLINE_TOKEN On 7th November at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national Indian Television News Channel managed an 11 minute interview with Sharmila. You may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations, sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic. Wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters. NEWLINE_TOKENThe page on Irom Sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense. Content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on UFO sightings, the history of double entry bookkeeping or Irom Sharmila. NEWLINE_TOKENSome examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long list of the Nobel Prize so he removed her nomination based on his opinion that long list nominations are not noteworthy. Hundreds of people are nominated every year for the long list. But there are now 7 billion people on this planet and I don’t believe any wiki editor has ever received a nomination or personally knows anyone who has. The short list is not published so wiki editors could argue it’s pure speculation. However informed opinion is published yearly by several respected organizations I believe one is called the Olaf trust (google is very helpful try it). For at least two consecutive years they have posited Sharmila as a possible on the short list which is always a single figure guess. Wiki editors have removed most of the smaller prizes offered to Sharmila because they didn’t like the Indian sounding names of the awards but they were fully referenced. Similarly they have removed at least one puppet production and two dance theatre productions about her. The graffiti image of her from Mumbhai is iconic. But because it wasn’t done by Banksy the snobbery of western wiki editors had it expunged. These people never use their real names and are bringing the concept of a free and open knowledge database into disrepute by the bullying and intimidation of anyone who disagrees with their nasty tactics in the case of this article. NEWLINE_TOKENUnless other wiki editors stand up to these petty racists who know nothing about India Manipur or Irom Sharmila yet pontificate on what can be posted here and now claim absolute power to remove any other editor who disagrees with them wiki is already dead. Hundreds will come to the article to learn more about Sharmila having read something somewhere and all will now leave disappointed because it adds nothing. The prime wiki editor of a people’s encylopaedia is people. The downside of giving the unqualified this sort of power is you reduce the quality and content of articles when ignorant bigot gangs take up personal vendettas. I presume the hope was you would only edit articles you where you had some knowledge of the subject. But some feel that they have now become professionalized wiki editors although they don’t need any outside reference to qualify them as experts.NEWLINE_TOKENBut back to the last key event that wiki will not allow to be noted along with many others. Usually before an interview the press are cautioned not to report any criticism of the Government of Manipur otherwise the privilege given to them will be removed. There’s an unspoken threat also that scribes have low life expectancy in Manipur. Manipur is like Sri Lanka only   : EDATA_7",dev,0

661392508.0,"SDATA_7 :  Having looked more closely at the initial references you linked me to (before even glancing at the latest ones) I now realize that they are multiple and all say the same thing, so I've redacted what I had originally said about it possibly being a typo - one or two typos are possible, consistently being wrong multiple times is not.  All I can state is that the novel has Elphinstone as the rank I stated, but quite possibly that was a literary tweak in order to make Christian the only Master's Mate. I'm certainly not going to claim the fictional variant is correct and all the non-fictional versions are wrong! Now that I look at Elphinstone's and Churchill's ages, Elphinstone (at 36) is 8 years older than Churchill (at 28) so it is unlikely, but by no means impossible, that Elphinstone was junior in rank to Churchill.  To be honest, I'm a bit confused why there would be 2 Master's Mates on the same ship with so small a crew - is that normal?  That would make it the only rank on the Bounty for which there was more than one instance other than quartermaster (and of course, able seaman!).  Anyway, I don't want to get stuck on this issue - I had asked who you the other Master's Mate was and you told me. My response to your reply is now a bit of a digression, but hopefully an informative one. Let's move on. Granted that Elphinstone is indeed a Master's Mate, the number of crew not berthed in the forecastle in point (5) below is now 15 not 14, which is still greater than 13.

Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don't necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  WesleyNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== Old Interpreted Language article ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIt is often a mistake to refer to a language as either ``interpreted`` or ``compiled``, becauseNEWLINE_TOKENmost languages can be implemented in either way, and some languagesNEWLINE_TOKEN(like Perl) are compiled atNEWLINE_TOKENruntime but behave as if they were interpreted.NEWLINE_TOKENOther languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into anNEWLINE_TOKENintermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).NEWLINE_TOKENSome languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAn example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIs Java interpreted, or what? NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Java programming language article says:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDCNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an ``eval`` statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldtNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWay too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of ``compiling``.NEWLINE_TOKENIt is used in two distinct meanings, as in:NEWLINE_TOKEN# compiled to machine code (or assembly)NEWLINE_TOKEN# compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representationNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI think it's wrong to call languages that use the second way ``compiled``. In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all ``compile`` source to some form of internal representation.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENQuote from FOLDOC:NEWLINE_TOKEN     CompilerNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN     A program that converts another programNEWLINE_TOKEN     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) toNEWLINE_TOKEN     {machine language} (object code).

It is quite obvious to me, and all the memembers of the SGAS, that your dissatisfaction with the page citations is not an indication of the article's ``dubiousness``, but rather an indication of your ignorance of Goosebumps and literature in general. If you think people need a citation as to where the camera in Say Cheese and Die came from,, then you need to understand what is common knowledge and not. For instance, If i were to write that the sky is blue, of that the earth is round, or that MACman202 has no idea what he is talking about, most reasonably intelligent humans would agree with such widely known facts. Such is the same for Goosebumps and R.L. Stine. When I say that the plots ``are masterfully formulated`` or imply that R.L. Stine is brilliant, the majority of people recognize that the two statements are widely known facts. NEWLINE_TOKENAs for you MACman202, any notion what so ever that you have the ability to recognize fine literature ``has to be one of the most laughable things I have ever heard`` (NatureBoy, I included quotations in the last quote so that you, always one to want a citation for the obvious, will know that I quote this MACman202 himself).

You can take comfort in the fact that you are not the only one guilty of this unjust censorhip. MACman202 and NatureBoy are just as guilty. Each of you should devote, as I have, your mind to understanding the beauty and brilliance of Goosebumps.

I would like to invite you to consider helping with the GA sweeps process. Sweeps helps to ensure that the oldest GAs still meet the criteria, and improve the quality of GAs overall. Unfortunately, last month only two articles were reviewed. This is definitely a low point after our peak at the beginning of the process when 163 articles were reviewed in September 2007. After nearly two years, the running total has just passed the 50% mark. In order to expediate the reviewing, several changes have been made to the process. A new worklist has been created, detailing which articles are left to review. All exempt and previously reviewed articles have already been removed from the list. Instead of reviewing by topic, you can consider picking and choosing whichever articles interest you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe are always looking for new members to assist with the remaining articles, so if you are interested or know of anybody that can assist, please visit the GA sweeps page. In addition, for every member that reviews 100 articles or has a significant impact on the process, s/he will get an award when they reach that threshold. If only 14 editors achieve this feat starting now, we would be done with Sweeps! Of course, having more people reviewing less articles would be better for all involved, so please consider asking others to help out. Feel free to stop by and only review a few articles, something's better than nothing! Take a look at the list, and see what articles interest you. Let's work to complete Sweeps so that efforts can be fully focused on the backlog at GAN. If you have any questions about the process, reviewing, or need help with a particular article, please contact me or  and we'll be happy to help. Happy editing!   •    : EDATA_7",dev,0

You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.NEWLINE_TOKEN:Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, ``son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right.`` So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria.

My understanding of the WP convention is that if a player is rostered with a club for any significant period of time, that club is listed in his infobox even if the player makes no appearances for the club.  If a player only passes through briefly and makes no appearances for the club, however, it isn't listed.  As for the other question, I'd say it's fairly common in the US for a player to spend a very brief period on the roster of one club before being traded to another: for instance, in the 2006 expansion draft, expansion franchise Toronto FC snapped up a couple of guys simply for their ``trade value`` and then proceeded to deal them to other teams in exchange for players they actually wanted.

Yes, it is true, that the clock father away will be faster due to the weaker gravitional field.

I wanted to share my account regarding how the RF acticle came into being, since my name has come up here. Sacha Feinman, a noted journalist http://www.linkedin.com/pub/sacha-feinman/17/400/976 contacted me about writing an article about Geraci. He was, as any good journalist would be, concerned with not simply regurgitating our investigation. However, reading my article, he felt it was well written, ivestigated, etc. He felt it would be a good springboard for further investigation. So, I provided all my sources to Feinman. He vetted the entire Bullshido piece, found it to be verifiable, and continued to investigate the case in further directions which Bullshido had not covered. As Feinman noted himself it was the Bullshido article which formed the basis for his own further investigation. Feinman and I did not collaborate on his article, other than my making introductions to sources and the subject, Geraci. Feinman was not paid by Bullshido, nor is he even a member of the site. He came to us because of our notability. I fail to see how the RF article, regardless of how much or little it sepcifically mentions Bullshido in print, could not be considered a notable reference for Bullshido. Our ivnestigation served as the springboard for his, he came to us because of our notability, he personally stated this as such, and the subject of the investigation itself (Geraci) is quoted in the RF article as saying the Bullshido investigation was accurate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis addresses both the neutrality and the reliability issues, and you didn't mention it in your summary.

There have been several times that I have wanted to award an Animation Barnstar to a fellow editor, only to be disappointed that one still doesn't exist. The closest thing that we have right now is the Film Barnstar, but this is only applicable in certain situations, since animation can be found in both film and television.

The first paragraph includes useful and clear overview of the topic, however, it could use a little more information that would broaden the interests of readers. They key points in this article are based on historical occurrences that have contributed to rapid changing events in the workforce and that also created a standard for change management in a way. The information includes sufficient information regarding the history and the context of this topic. It most definitely covers a variety of topics, including the reasons for such change. In addition to that, the article addresses the key issues including globalization and technology that have heavily influenced change management. There is therefore well supported evidence throughout the article and the analysis of certain models proves that the article is referenced and can be proven with contextual information. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article itself has a clear focus on a topic and also includes detailed scholarly support throughout the text, which can be found in the reference section. The contribution considers a variety of perspectives, however, I think it primarily focuses on today’s rapidly changing world, in reference towards globalization and technology and maybe could focus more than just a few scholars. It takes an appropriate tone in providing points of view in the context of globalization and technology and is supported with appropriate references throughout the page. I think for this article there are sufficient references but more references can always be beneficial and offer more content. NEWLINE_TOKENThe article represents a neutral point of view but in a way is sort of drawn towards today’s issues in terms of globalization and technology and offers a certain point of view. It does a good job staying with the facts and avoiding opinions. In terms of article length, the only thing I would suggest is a longer intro with a little more information for the reader to have. NEWLINE_TOKENOverall, it’s a well written entry with detailed information about change management. I couldn’t find any grammatical errors or any misspellings and the text itself reads well and expresses good ideas. In terms of structure, I would only add more information to the introduction to give the reader more background knowledge.  : EDATA_7",dev,0

For centuries these two cultures would have many periods of cultural exchange and of cultural strife.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMost of scholars and philologists alike contend that the modern Albanian language to be descended from Illyrian.(check the atlas of world in Barnes Noble,see where they put the Albanian languange)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Illyrian name is understood in the Albanian interpretation of the Illyrians, ``Ilirët.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe root in ``Ilirët`` is ``i lir`` which simply means, ``FREE.`` Thus, the meaning of ``Ilirët`` is ``freemen`` and the meaning of Illyria (long before America came into existence) is ``land of the free.`` NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe first references,that of 1285 cf.Jirecek 1901,1904,Ajeti 1977,1982,occurs not in Albania itself but in Dubrovnik(Ragusa) where a sizeable Albaniancommunity had existed for some time.In the investigation of a robbery in the house of Petro del Volcio of Belena(now Prati),a certain Matthew,son of Mark of Mançe, who appears to have been witness to the crime states:NEWLINE_TOKEN``Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua Albanesca`` `` I heara a voice crying in the mountains in the Albanian languange``NEWLINE_TOKENand I sure those who study Albanian history have 4 more importan references.(they should know that)NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhat is the significance of these references? First and foremost, it is apparent that in the period 1285 to 1322 the Albanian languange was well-established on the southeastern Adriatic coast.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe dating of these refernces,should not however be taken as an indication that Albanian or early forms of it were not spoken in the preceding centuries.If the Albanians,tells us were rural nomads,warlike inhabitants,and if their settlements were more concentrated in the highlands than on the coast,it is quite likely that they were not taken note of, even though they may have costituted at substantial population group. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMost historians of the Balkans believe the Albanian people are in large part descendants of the ancient Illyrians, who, like other Balkan peoples, were subdivided into tribes and clans. The name Albania is derived from the name of an Illyrian tribe called the Arbër, or Arbëresh, and later Albanoi, that lived near Durrës.Only Albanians preserve the Illyrian names ex; me my name is Taulant-Taulantët illyrians tribes, Genti,Bardhyl,Dori,Boiken,Bato etc etc so the question is How come Albanians are the only one to preserve this names and languange? and NO its not communist propaganda, my greatgrandfather's name was Bardhyl and his dads was Agroni.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe most known Illyrian sign is the snake or dragons rolled or twisted, that Illyrians used in their shields & in their art.Dragons and snakes were worshiped by Illyrians, they still continue to exist until this day in Albanian mythology...NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENGreek roots with Illyrian its a stupid argument,mixing oil with water,I never heard that Greeks claiming Illyrians.One point its true, some did mix with Greeks, I am sure not everyone was isolated on southern Illyria from the Albanian hardesh geography or imigrated towards Italy.NEWLINE_TOKENGreeks have their old history and I don't think they need Illyrians to prove that.NEWLINE_TOKEN::I was the one who started the Greek colonies because they show that we all have a worked together but never thought that it will end up like this, with maps to be used for nationalistic ideas,to claim lands.Epir it was and is to the Albanians,Greeks,Albanian-Greeks,Greeks-Albanian people. We need to show some respect,from those mountaints of north west of Greece (south of Albania) Pyrros, Bubullima,Boçari etc called home.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI don't like nationalist of any kind, its 2008 people,there is thousand of books about Albanians,wake up, but to delete critical points that linked Albanians with Illyrians its wrong,shame on u people, it makes Wikipedia looks bad and it shows that some people still leave in the past.NEWLINE_TOKEN::All these Roman/Byzantine/Greekcolonies articles need to be on one article,they are too long.I would suggest  to help in here,I really do think he is the only (Greek) Wikipedian that can really help and has an open mind.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWe know that the shadow of the ancient Greece was too strong/too close for the Illyrian Albanian civilization, but at least try to understand that not everyone who dresses Levis, listens to hip-hop or writes grafitti in English ... is an American........ `  : EDATA_7",dev,0

401575561.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI believe the following description on the page http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_sensor_size is false: ``However, the larger area does not imply a better low-light sensitivity or higher signal-to-noise ratio. While the light collecting area is larger, this is canceled out by the fact that the same total light from the scene is spread out over a larger area, that is, the light flux per square mm is lower, for a fixed aperture diameter. Larger sensors can still be advantageous for low-light applications because typically lenses for them exist with larger apertures than are possible for smaller sensors.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe following was my attempt to correct this information:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``A given lens will provide the same density of light on any sensor at a given aperture. For sensors with the same number of megapixels (MP), a large sensor will have proportionately larger pixels. The pixels on a 10 MP Full-Frame sensor will be more than twice as large as the pixels on an APS-C (2.3 times for Nikon, and 2.6 times for Canon). The larger pixel size is one of the reasons that full frame sensors typically have both superior sensitivity and reduced noise in low light in comparison to smaller sensors.  The smaller sensor is equivalent to a cropped section of the larger sensor but with smaller pixels, therefore much of the light from a full frame lens will fall off the edges of the smaller sensor and is ``wasted.`` Theoretically, a 10 MP (Canon) APS-C sensor should perform the same as a 26.3 MP full frame sensor, all other factors being equal.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAlthough a given lens will produce the same depth of field (DOF) regardless of the sensor, in practice DOF is also affected by the sensor size. This is because at a given focal length the photographer must stand further away from the subject in order to frame the same shot when using a camera with a smaller sensor. Since the DOF increases with the focal distance (distance between the lens and the subject), a photograph taken with an APS-C camera will have a deeper DOF than the identical photograph taken with a full frame camera using the same lens and aperture setting. The photographer can alternatively select a wider angle lens for the APS-C camera and stand at the same focal distance as with the full frame camera to frame the same shot, however the DOF will be affected in the exact same way since DOF also increases with wider angle (shorter focal length) lenses.``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHowever it was deleted with no counter argument or explanation of the facts.

Kurds have it in their homes and are allowed to have them. It is certainly not criminal in Iran for Kurds to have the Kurdish flag or symbol as many of my friends do. So edit your statement about it being criminal in Iran. Need I remind you all, that Kurds are ethnic Iranians and have historically enjoyed the greatest liberties in Iran as opposed to the mainstream discrimination Kurds face in Syria, Iraq, and Turkey?  NEWLINE_TOKENIt is usually Israeli sources, with increasing American and British help and aid, that intentionally falsely claim that the Kurdish flag (which fly the Pan-Iranian colours as does the unofficial flag of the Azerbaijani people and the flag of Tajikistan) is prohibited in Iran. FLYING THE KURDISH FLAG IN IRAN IS NOT CRIMINAL AS IT IS MENTIONED BY ISRAELI SOURCES. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENFurthermore, I go on to read that there was research done that basically proves Kurds and Jews are genetically the same. It seems to me that certain individuals who I can see are Israeli are following the Israeli states policy of editing articles in lines with current events in the Middle East. Kurds are Iranians just as how Russians, Serbs, Poles, and Bulgarians are all Slavic peoples. Israel, the USA, and Britain are trying to create conflict in Iran as was done in the former Yugoslavia by creating problems along ethnic lines. This is called ‘balkanisation.’ The Israelis are doing this covertly through operations in Iraqi Kurdistan.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENPropaganda for dividing and conquering people starts with definitions then the manipulation of history. I am an academic in the fields of anthropology and history and an Iranian from a minority group that is neither Persian nor Kurdish. I can tell you that Kurds are definitely ethnic Iranians in all senses from tradition to language, history, culture, identity, and genetics. I am alarmed by the current purging of internet articles that have hidden agendas trying to separate the Iranian identity of Kurds. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs I was told by a Kurdish professor, Mr. Eskandari in Tehran: “Kurds are Iranian and the entity of Iran as a state and nation was founded by the [main] ancestors of the Kurds, the Mede who established Iran as an empire. One problem that has compounded the issue is that people misuse the term Persian and Iranian. Persians are Iranian, but all Iranians, like the Kurds and Ossetians, are not Persians.”NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Mede and other similar Iranian groups are the ancestors of the Kurds, but not the only group, just like how the ancient Persians are the main ancestors of the modern Persians, but not the only ancestors. Ancestors of Persians and Kurds also include Arabs, Mongols, and other Iranian peoples. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI ask all the honest people on this site who wish to enhance knowledge not to take part in this fabrication of fact. There was a time when the Turkish government tried to convince Kurds that they were “Mountain Turks” and now there are powers at play that are either trying to disassociate the Kurds from their Iranian identity and origins or make whole generations of proud young Kurds forget or be unaware of their Iranian ethnicity. This is due to geo-strategic schemes. These forces are trying to victimize a whole group of people from knowing their own proud history and culture which is genuinely Iranian. The covert foreign policy of Israel, Britain, and America comes at the expense of the Kurds and even their history and culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN“THE ENEMIES OF SCIENCE, THE ARTS, AND KNOWLEDGE ARE THE ENEMIES OF ALL MANKIND!”  : EDATA_7",dev,0

Moulton NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN=== Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans As a Governance Tool ===NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOf the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEvidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAnd yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENWhen Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOr as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh!“NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN''Further comments by readers of the P2P Foundation may be found [http://blog.p2pfoundation.net  : EDATA_7",dev,0

Before I begin, I'd like to apologise for the accusation of harassment, whilst I was feeling harassed by your comments I believe I over reacted due to the off-wiki stress of moving house. With that agreement above, I'm hoping we can move on. I'm hoping to get RfA Reform wrapped up 2012, there's been some very good research done, a few very resonable proposals which will be brought to the community to decide on them (even if I don't personally agree with them). NEWLINE_TOKENYou mention above that the RfA Reform project is dead without an an article writer as a leader, though you and I disagree on what constitutes an article writer, I would love to see one of those names helping in the project - even as co-ordinator. However, since none of them has shown any interest in RfA Reform and they are all busy with other things, I'm not going to hold my breath. Please do feel free to nudge any of them though - I'm sure a comment from you would go down much better than one from me, since I haven't interacted with any particularly. NEWLINE_TOKENAs for the unsavoury behaviour towards editors, I am actively trying to minimise this. For example, Keepscases, I did much research into his questions in the last quarter of last year, who removed them, how they were answered and so on. I don't believe I published it on wiki, though I could dig it up for you. From that, I came to the conclusion that Keepscases questions were not a major issue - and discussed that with a few of the editors who had issues with that user. I don't believe there has been any comments regarding Keepscases since, though I know there are still editors who are unhappy with the questions at RfA.NEWLINE_TOKENRegarding Malleus Fatuorum, I do endorse a topic ban from discussing administrators, as I believe that would remove the majority of problems and would be a much better solution than a blunt instrument like a block. Unfortunately, that does mean also topic banning him from RfA, which is a pity because his votes generally appear to be well worded (it's the comment's outside the votes, and the comments at WT:RfA which are problematic). In any case, that's a personal opinion, which I've explained with evidence at the the ArbCom case. If ArbCom choose to disagree, I'm not going to persue that further. NEWLINE_TOKENAll in all, I'd love to see RfA Reform actually improve RfA - I'm not 100% it can, because of project wide failings, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to try. I'm hoping to do some work improving the de-sysop process too, I'd like to see a more clear system there too. Finally, would you mind laying off the ``RfA Deform`` comment? It belittles the project and only serves to make things more difficult, you are the only editor who uses that phrase - so I'd appreciate it if you could drop it.  ·  `  : EDATA_7",dev,1

Now there were only really four pages that I was really shocked about seeing deleted, which were Tim Newman, Reagan Penn, Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick, as they all match Wikipedia's MMA notability criteria. NEWLINE_TOKENTim Newman has already fought for BAMMA to two occasions, which were BAMMA 4 and BAMMA 5, and he is scheduled to fight on the BAMMA 8 card, all of which have links supporting this. So even thought he has only technically fought for BAMMA twice, because he is clearly a true member of the BAMMA roster, and unless something happens to him which means he cannot compete at BAMMA 8, I find that deleting his Wikipedia page was a massive error for everyone who participated in that debate. NEWLINE_TOKENWith Reagan Penn, he doesn't necessary need the sympathy factor for being BJ Penn, as he is currently competing for ProElite, which as we know is a second tier MMA organisation, as they were the same people who have created EliteXC, and everyone agrees that with the attention ProElite are getting now that they are a second tier organisation, so that means that the only thing Penn is missing is a thrid fight under them, and telling by how excited ProElite are having a Penn fighting for them I'd imagine that he will get another fight for them, possibly for the next card, so that means that deleting his Wikipedia card can be seen as being premature, as if he decided to retire after his second bout then fair enough, but he hasn't so far so once again another blunder for those who participated in that debate. NEWLINE_TOKENFinally we have Jamaine Facey and Jake Bostwick. Now these two guys have competed for Cage Rage and Cage Rage UK, both second tier organisations. They both fought on the main cards of Cage Rage on one or two occasions, and competed for the contender cards at least three times each, which means they were already deserving of their positions on here. They are always competing on the main cards of Cage Rage UK which, again, means that the still deserve their spots on here. So for another blunder I would like to see all FOUR men have their pages reinstated as soon as possible, as I'm beginning to suspect that something is not right with the legitimacy of the user/s (who I will keep anonymous so I don't get accused of personal attacks again) who are calling for many pages of mine to be deleted, which also includes the deleting of the Cage Rage UK/UCMMA Wikipedia page, as this orgainisation is one of the big three in the United Kingdom, along side BAMMA and Cage Warriors.

You (Grandmaster) mentioned earlier Joseph P. Smith (1952) but (i) his book has an extremely thin link with the debate on the dating, (ii) he's not specialised in this area, and most of all (iii) he didn't take side in his very few lines on Moses. Topchyan not being contradicted on this, it is clear that there's a break of 21 years between Malkhasyants' book and the next serious scholar contesting the 5th c. dating (according to Topchyan, ``la publication de son livre régla la question pour environ deux décennies`` or in English ``the publishing of his book settled the issue for approximately two decades``). Therefore, during these two decades, the issue didn't ``remain`` disputed (i.e. no serious scholarship published), and Toumanoff' s publishing ``revived`` the critical points in 1961.NEWLINE_TOKEN# Where you perhaps have a point (with ``remains``) is that Toumanoff's main point, the ``Bagratids argument``, had already been raised before by Adontz and Manandian. It had been addressed by Malkhasyants though (i.e. Moses wrote that Bagratids were tagadir ev aspet, two titles from the Arsacid period which were forgotten in latter centuries).NEWLINE_TOKEN# I think the article should represent both the historiographical break and the historiographical link, and I think the current sentence do so (``revived... continue to maintain``). I tried to reword it, but in fact, the more I think about the issue and the more I read the sentence, the less I see the problem with it.NEWLINE_TOKEN  NEWLINE_TOKEN:Oh, btw, no need to attack Toptchyan: Mahé for instance gives absolutely no reference between 1940 and 1961.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Did you actually read Sarkissian's article? He quotes authors from 1920s and 1930s, and says: NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Such was, and to a large extent still is, the traditional view about the life and the work of Moses of Khoren which was accepted by the Armenians. It is this traditional and unquestioned view that has been subjected to much severe criticism during the course of the past hundred years. The object of this paper is to summarize and evaluate such criticism.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:So according to Sarkissian, during the 100 years before 1940 the 5th century dating was constantly in dispute. Thus, Topchyan contradicts other sources. Criticism was not revived, it always existed. If you insist on revived claim, it must be presented only as Topchyan's personal opinion, and not as a fact, because it is not true.  `  : EDATA_7",dev,0

Central, can you explain something to me? You obviously don't like JWs so why do you spend so much time thinking about us? Personally, I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset. Yet I notice that JWs and related articles are the only subject you deal with on WP. I doesn't [sic] make any sense to me at all - what's up with that! As it says on the WP main page, ``In this English version, started in 2001, we are currently working on 730,275 articles.`` Wouldn't you be happier branching out to some of the other subjects on WP. Just a thought. DannyMuse ``NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENHo hum, here we go. . . I see your inevitable desire to posit straw men has taken the better of you again (yawn). You stated: ``You obviously don't like JWs. . .`` Actually Danny I have some friends who are JWs, and I have no problem with them as individual per se. If you actually opened your eyes for once you would see I have problems with your religious leaders, not JWs. Although rank and file JWs are still responsible for selling their literature and promoting the false teachings of the Watch Tower commercial publishing organisation. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYour second reality admittance is very revealing, you said: ``I try to avoid thinking about things that I don't like or that make me upset.`` You sure do Danny, as do most JWs, and don't think it hasn't been noted by thousands of viewers of these pages. Very sad indeed when someone who claims he is part of the ``channel of God``, and ``the only narrow road to salvation``, shrinks back in fear whenever you see anything you don't like. This is exactly why so many in this world get deceived and trapped in false religions, they just look away when reality comes knocking. This is also why you will most probably waste the rest of your life in a region that is not what it claims to be and lose your future opportunities with God through self-deception. Danny, never underestimate the power of denial, it will steal all your relationship with God, and you will probably let that happen.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDanny, I will not argue with you, as you are not ready to see reality at present, I pray one day you will be able, but maybe that time is not yet. I will leave it with God, if he wants you, he will open your eyes. Until then, I will leave you with some advice from your own organisation; on this occasion, you should take that advice. Regards, , 15 September 2005NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:``Even some religious people have closed minds. They are interested only in ``their`` religion, showing no willingness to as much as listen to the views of others. And even though they may not have chosen their religion but simply have inherited it from their parents, still they feel that their religion must be right. But not every inheritance is necessarily good. . . What makes a religion right is its total adherence to God's Word. Whether our religion meets this criterion or not can only be determined by open-mindedly comparing it with the Bible. . Why, some people have even been known to doubt the truthfulness of a message simply on the basis of where the message bearer came from . . An open mind is willing to do what 1 John 4:1 recommends.

Truth is, Opas wrote many articles, which have always clearly stated the ``facts`` - that only one single shot was heard by all persons and prison officer Paterson testified he fired one single shot. Also, prison officer Pascoe admitted on national television in 1986 (19 years after Ryan was hanged) that he fired a shot from tower 3, which might have killed Hodson. Pascoe stated that he was a young scared coward at the time for keeping quiet as he didn't want to get into trouble and lose his job. Hence, there has been much speculation over the decades of where the fatal shot was fired from, and by whom. The ``fact`` remains that the police and prosecution failed, for whatever reason, to provide a shred of scientific forensic evidence, which would have proven beyond reasonable doubt who's rifle fired the fatal shot. Nobody's rifle was ever tested. There were lots of prison officers with lots of rifles at the time everyone heard one single shot. Not one single rifle, including Ryan's rifle, was tested for evidence. This is a ``fact``. Purrum should stick to the ``facts`` rather than contribute opinions, views, allegations without substance.   07:52`  : EDATA_7",dev,0

In terms of the notability of the subject, the newspaper articles I have referenced talk about his popularity in Australia where he was a regular on television and popular. I'm happy for the page to be edited if anyone has better sources than me. I think that part of the issue is that his peak in popularity was during a period where the internet barely existed. It probably also doesn't help that he's Australian and therefore not as well known as he may be if he was on American television. He would regularly sell out 2,000-3,000 seat venues during his peak. I understand that these things need to be verifiable and that my article may not be up to scratch, but for a first time attempt at editing a Wikipedia article, it's difficult to navigate the seemingly convoluted process (to the uninitiated like myself).

65396433.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENWell as for Bynes her father's surname doesn't really match either, does it? I find surnames in 2006 can be grossly misleading and don't necessarily mean much. In 1900, sure, but at this point everyone's changed their names and intermarried enough that you can't tell who is what by last name. Why wouldn't Eli's father be Jewish? He's Joseph Cross, also the father of actress Flora Cross, who is Jewish but whose mother is apparently not Eli's mother. There are seemingly a bunch of Jewish ``Cross``'s out there, anyway. Well in the case of footnotes the point is really - the list is called a list of Jewish people - so the most important part is really whether the person themselves is ``Jewish``. The mistake I guess many made before is thinking that the most important part was whether one of their parents or something are Jewish. I think adding a quote about Elvis' ancestry however is important since in his case it is a big stretch and it's for the most part, something that biographers added on after his death, so it would definitely be helpful. But in cases like Bynes, Lauren Storm, plenty of others it's really mostly irrelevant if they are not ``ethnically`` fully Jewish (and besides, that can be found out in their entry), same for the other X-American lists, establishing that someone is Italian-American is good enough, for example, on List of Italian American actors, I'm sure Tina Majorino's mother isn't Italian (with Italians, unlike Jews, you can obviously tell that if someone's mother's maiden name is ``Black`` they are most likely not Italian) but the source just calls her Italian, so that's good enough for us. Family tree stuff isn't the most important. Plus - of course - most of the quotes in the numbers for people who are half already say they are half - but I'll go over them below here. As for practicing Judaism - well of the people who are half and whose one non-Jewish parent didn't convert in the 1980s - LaBeouf was raised Jewish/practices and the source quoted says he is Cajun also, Scarlett wore a Star of David to a bunch of events, Jake Gyllenhaal was raised Jewish, and the quote says he is only Jewish on his mother's side anyway, Grey raised Jewish, Flynn's mother apparently converted, Feldman raised Jewish and the quote says his mother wasn't, Carter quote says his father is Jewish only, Bynes says she is ``Jewish`` and we don't even know which parent (actually for the longest time Wikipedia, under someone's assumption, had ``Jewish mother``. But this was removed once I came in and started purging these assumption games other editors played and started putting in only verified facts )), Bilson quote says she is half Italian half Jewish, ditto for Baldoni, Paxton quote says all we know, that she is Jewish (maybe her non-Jewish parent converted), Peck grew up with a Jewish single mother, he doesn't know who his biological father was and he was likely Jewish anyway, Prepon we don't know which parent, Reed's brother had a Bar Mitzvah and sources/herself have called her ``Jewish``, Schwartzman - dunno, Sigler mother converted, Thomas raised Jewish, and the source says his father isn't anyway, Vuolo father converted, Wilson raised Jewish, I think that's about it. So, as you can see, for a large number of these, the quote already says that they aren't ``ethnically`` all Jewish if that was relevant. OK, as for JInfo, yes, it seems to definitely fall under ``some guy's website``. It does sometime cite sources, right? But often it doesn't. So I would say, yes, generally do not use it.  `  : EDATA_7",dev,0

128724796.0,"SDATA_7 :  `CCD affecting other insects?==NEWLINE_TOKENWhile all this is certainly entertaining, the qoute does not stand on its own in that even if all honeybee populations collapse, mankind will not disappear. Wild pollinator insects, animals, and even wind can still pollinate many even most edible food crops. Even if those crops that depend solely on domestic bee pollenation cannot be produced any longer, humans would adapt agriculture to fill those niches.  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:At this point it's not clear yet that CCD only affects bees.  It certainly stands to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder.  Also, the quote may be overly simplified.  But the big picture is that without pollinators, things are much more difficult. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:I have not seen any references that have indicated that wild bee populations, wild pollinators or other insects have been affected by the same disorder. If you know of any references that cite a similar decline in native or wild pollinators it may be helpful to include a section on this. NEWLINE_TOKEN::Wild bees are generally becoming rare in the Western world due to habitat destruction. This is AFAIK most severe in C Europe.  NEWLINE_TOKEN::I agree that wild bees are increasingly rare worldwide, but the cause has little if anything to do with colony collapse.  NEWLINE_TOKEN:::``Little if anything``? The proper and correct response is it has nothing to do with CCD. Even in the event that CCD should prove to be a ``disease``, diseases are rather specific in what they affect, and a disease that affects honey bees is unlikely to affect any other insects; and there are only 7 species of honey bees. It's like expecting that a disease that affects deer will spread to other mammals, such as humans. That is an unreasonable expectation - it most definitely does NOT ``stand to reason that other insects could be affected by the same disorder`` - the reality is exactly the opposite. The seven species in the genus Apis have had something on the order of 35 million years of independent evolution - 35 million years for their genomes to diverge from those of all other insects; compare that to the 70 million years mammals have existed. The human genome has had about as much time to diverge from deer, as the honey bee genome has had to diverge from other bees. But no one expects humans and deer to be affected by the same diseases. Why should a honey bee disease affect other bees?NEWLINE_TOKEN:::While it is certainly true that habitat destruction and climate change are major threats to pollinating insects, bees foremost among them, CCD, even in a worst-case scenario, is not a threat to anything outside of agriculture.

The use of flags is, for the third time, a graphic means of presenting information instead of saying England, England, England, England, England, England, oh! Wales, England, England, etc., ad nauseum. It is NOT ``purely to render some colourful graphics``. The use of graphics to convey information is widespread in all spheres of communication, not just the internet. As for folk using it in other articles, well, if they do then that presents a consensus, doesn't it? No, the match was not an international but the nationalities of the players are relevant in football because for the last thirty-odd years since the arrivals of Ardiles and Villa, nationality has been and still is a burning issue in English football. There are people now who will reluctantly admit that Liverpool have more top-class English players than anyone else at present but still criticise the club for employing South Americans.

Climategate and Wikipedia == NEWLINE_TOKENhttp://blogs.news.com.au/heraldsun/andrewbolt/index.php/heraldsun/comments/climategate_how_the_cabal_controlled_wikipediaNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne person in the nine-member Realclimate.org team — U.K. scientist and Green Party activist William Connolley — would take on particularly crucial duties.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENConnolley took control of all things climate in the most used information source the world has ever known – Wikipedia. Starting in February 2003, ... Connolley set to work on the Wikipedia site. He rewrote Wikipedia’s articles on global warming, on the greenhouse effect, on the instrumental temperature record, on the urban heat island, on climate models, on global cooling. On Feb. 14, he began to erase the Little Ice Age; on Aug.11, the Medieval Warm Period. In October, he turned his attention to the hockey stick graph. He rewrote articles on the politics of global warming and on the scientists who were skeptical of the band. Richard Lindzen and Fred Singer, two of the world’s most distinguished climate scientists, were among his early targets, followed by others that the band especially hated, such as Willie Soon and Sallie Baliunas of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, authorities on the Medieval Warm Period.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAll told, Connolley created or rewrote 5,428 unique Wikipedia articles. His control over Wikipedia was greater still, however, through the role he obtained at Wikipedia as a website administrator, which allowed him to act with virtual impunity. When Connolley didn’t like the subject of a certain article, he removed it — more than 500 articles of various descriptions disappeared at his hand. When he disapproved of the arguments that others were making, he often had them barred — over 2,000 Wikipedia contributors who ran afoul of him found themselves blocked from making further contributions… In these ways, Connolley turned Wikipedia into the missionary wing of the global warming movement.NEWLINE_TOKENLet's see how long this Talk comment lasts!

184087305.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENpopulism as a positive term, and a critique of criticsNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSince I wrote last fall, several notable developments in the scholarship and discussion of populism have occurred. The South African intellectual and scholar Xolela Mangcu has entered the global discussion, building on a highly visible lecture he gave in Cape Town for the Wolpe Trust last June 18, ``Jacob Zuma on the Politics of Grievance`` (http://www.wolpetrust.org.za/dialogue2007/mangcupaper.pdf ). In this lecture Mangcu takes issue with what he sees as the discussions of ``populism`` that caricature its meanings and history as simply a rhetorical stance or politics of popular grievance against elites. He developed this argument in his weekly column in Business Day December 7, 2007, drawing on Gianna Pomata's scholarship on the history of populism in Europe  and her treatment of populist critics as part of an intellectual tradition of ``Enlightenment rationalism`` and growing separation of of popular and elite intellectual cultures. He also makes  a number of parallels with South African journalists and scholars whom he believes treat populism in very superficial ways. . Mangcu also develops these arguments in his forthcoming book, To the Brink (Universityof Kwa Xulu Natal, 2008), sure to create a major discussion in African academic and intellectual circles since he is widely described as the main intellectual heir to Steve Biko, the founder of the Black Consciousness Movement. FOr an excerpt of his forthcoming book see http://book.co.za/bookchat/topic.php?id=2079NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs far as Mike Huckabee's ``populism`` is concerned, the piece by David Kirkpatrick in the New York Times January 13, 2008 (``Young Evangelicals Embrace Huckabee``) has a detailed discussion of why many Catholics and evangelicals see him as populist. The article, among many in the American election season, is shows the strikingly difference valence of populism in the US and Europe. In the US the term, on balance, clearly has positive associations  otherwise major candidates like Edwards and Huckabee would not use it in self-description. This is  a product, most likely, of the much greater public awareness of the history of democratic movements like the 19th century farmers' cooperatives, New Deal reform, and the black freedom strucggle as broadly populist.

The golden ratio naturally appears in the 5th roots of unity; if you plot the roots in the complex plane, they form the vertices of a pentagon. This then explains why you can express a lot of trigonometric angles pi*n/5 in terms of the golden ratio. For example, cos 18 = (b/4)sqrt[2] = 5^(1/4)/2 sqrt[φ].  When you solve a quintic equation, naturally the fifth roots of unity are involved, hence why the radical solution of the quintic x^5-5x+12 = 0 can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio.

I don't believe that we should base our editing decisions on the quality (or lack thereof) of the Haynes and Boone PR office, who arguably should not have been editing that article in the first place anyhow.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: My firm belief is that details of the office locations of a law firm are essential to properly understanding that firm. If a firm has ten offices in the United States it could have ten offices in Kansas, ten offices in California, ten offices in New York or ten offices spread across Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, San Fransico, Dallas, Washington etc. In each case it would be a very different firm. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: The same is true of the UK. Leeds, Birmingham, Manchester and London are all very different legal markets, and are all very different again from Croydon, Oxford, Norwich or Brighton. The location of the offices is very important in understanding the market that the firm is operating in - in my view it is as important as the number of lawyers, the turnover of the firm and the profits per partner.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: Again, I completely accept that at a certain point it becomes impractical to list all of a firm's offices in their Wikipedia article. That is clearly the case for PwC, with over 750 offices. I personally do not feel that 69 offices is an excessively large number to detail however, and the revised format of the list now takes up only a few lines in the article.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: Please consider that you are seeking to reduce the sum total of information available to Wikipedia readers. How do readers benefit from the deletion of this information? I can't see any way in which they do. And how do they gain? Again, I can't see any way in which they do. The information is correct, is cited and is factual. It helps readers' understanding of the firm. It is no more advertising than the article of a car manufacturer giving details of the cars that it makes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::::::: I appreciate that I am outnumbered in this particular discussion but do feel strongly that as a point of principal law firm articles should be allowed to have details of office locations, and that to not allow this would be to single out law firms and treat them differently to many other commerical organisations on wikipedia where far more extensive details of their products and services are allowed. The number of articles, replete with attractive photos and impressive performance details of BMW cars is for example very large: List of BMW vehicles.

559912359.0,"SDATA_7 :  `NEWLINE_TOKEN:::The article's current treatment of the cult issue is unsatisfactory. It quotes journalist Ian Johnson at length for his ``common sense`` argument that Falun Gong is not a cult (``its members marry outside the group, have outside friends, hold normal jobs...``). However, it fails to quote any professional cult scholars, like Singer, except to deride their work as ``legitimizing`` the crackdown. The respect towards the anticult movement within academia—an unclear issue, but continuously repeating that they are an ``extreme fringe`` does not automatically make it true—is not necessary to have their opinions in the article. The issue of whether Falun Gong is a cult is important to cover from the point of view of studying the media battle between Falun Gong and the outside world. The fact that apologist authors like Ownby are forced to grapple with the cult issue - even if his comments, like Johnson's, are based on personal impressions and not an objective psychological checklist like Singer's - means that the question is notable. BTW, the academic field of religious studies is well-known for its postmodernist defenses of what popular opinion nearly unanimously derides as dangerous cults, like Scientology.

Second, you have misread my statement and missed my major point about vagina and penis. The point is that the article itself explans that a vaginoplasty is surgery to create a vagina. It is therefore obvious that any photographs of surgery in and around a penis or vagina will contain such things in the photograph. I believe that is is entirely appropriate to set the example that photographs of genitalia in medical and educational contexts are appropriate for all audiences. I believe that the precedent should be set that the penis and the vagina or more accurately in most cases the vulva should not be given special attention in medical contexts. To do so, gives the misimpression that there is something ``wrong`` with human genitalia, which is a falsehood, and an antedeluvian cultural bias whose primitive nature should be abolished. In this century and millenium, is it time for such puritanical prudishness to end. One of the best ironies of discussions about such ``warnings`` around medical photos is that they primarily serve to heighten the existence and nature of the photographs, and probably invite more study of them than might otherwise occur. In other words, they have the opposite of their intended purpose. The tend to draw more attention to such material, than might otherwise occur, while the tacit intention of people who want to put similarly silly warnings about such material is to ``hide`` them and be bashful around them. It is high time that humans grow up and get over this silly aversions to the site of human genitalia. The wikipedia should be a place that sets an appropriate standard that medical information should be free from the psuedo censorship that such ``warnings`` represent. On another note, on the basis of WP:V, a large portion of the wikipedia would be candidate for deletion. I believe such mention constitutes evidence that this article is being given unfair over-attention by a tacit faction whose true purpose is to censor subjects like the sort to which Toby Meltzer and its ``Good Article`` subject matter relates.

In fact, a book of Lawrence Stone's (as I recall) demonstrates that Lord Burghley put the Earl of Rutland, a royal ward, on his feet again financially through his management of Rutland's affairs during Rutland's wardship (Lord Burghley was a good friend of Rutland's stepmother).  The wardship system was a cash cow for the Tudor monarchy, and although Lord Burghley doubtless profited from his position as Master, he did not take financial advantage of his royal wards.  In particular, since this article is about Oxford, Lord Burghley did not take financial advantage of Oxford during his wardship.

428320799.0,"SDATA_7 :  =Am I disruptive ?NEWLINE_TOKENSteve, the criticism of Calo's paper is addressed in the two articles by Cloonan and Trell  that are also in the Wikipedia article about Ruggero Santilli. These two articles were there, you ignored them and quickly eliminated the entire section. There was also another article about ongoing experiments that you ignored and cancelled...but you erased everything so nobody knows....in addition you and i are not qualified to take on pros or cons, just to report it and you avoided and prohibited that. I do not know where the idea of law suit came from. You are the one who got the three legal points and said that you were saying everything you wanted since no legal  suit could be won against you . What a fine example of editorial ethics, I already told what I think about your position, but you ignored it.  If you  do not want to add the articles, as are in the Wikipedia page itself , I could not care less, it is the loss of the readers who do not read about ongoing research with its pros and cons. I thought  it was interesting since I am sure there  are more and that shows a vital field of research. However I take issue with associating Santilli, with fraud, kook, fringe  and I am sure that it is against the rules of Wikipedia on libel and reckless behavior with the clear intent to damage since the fringe scientist definition is not supported by anything of value,  except, perhaps some blogs and  tabloids which, according to the rules, have no source value since they are not peer-reviewed articles!

This person's IP seems to change frequently (I've seen edits from 69.225.5.4, 69.225.5.183, 69.226.111.130, 69.226.106.109, and 69.226.103.13 apparently from this same user on WT:BRFA in the past 5 or so months), and I guess he eventually created this ``IP69.226.103.13`` account to answer concerns over that; at times he still neglects to log in. I have no indication as to whether he has other accounts or just extensive experience as an IP user. I know of at least one short civility block for this user, although I don't recall the specific IP. In general, I've found the user helpful when not overreacting to various issues, which unfortunately does occur rather often. I'm not sure whether an indef would be a net positive for the project or not. You'd have to identify and examine his contributions under his various IP addresses to get a full picture.

It is also useful for archiving sections that bots don't archive automatically on other talk pages for various reasons.  While it is acceptable to use only OneClickArchiver on a user's talk page if that is what they wish and the size of their page doesn't get out of hand, bots should archive all other talk pages.

Indian or Spectacled cobras (Naja naja) of course have two ocelli or eyespot markings on the back of their hood.  (These are thought to serve as ``eyes in the back of the head,`` with the adaptive function of deterring predators that might try to attack the standing cobra from behind).

Nor is there any reason to assume that the urine flavor (presuming there is one at all) should be concentrated at the skin; given that the process of shark urination is an osmotic exchange, the urine should be evenly distributed throughout the system, and, if anything, *less* concentrated at the skin.

I think we might be best off creating our own definitionnot in the sense of original research, but purely for the purpose of better organizing the encyclopedia. Here's a thought (just a rudimentary idea): let's say there are passive and active tools. Passive tools create no tangible effectthese are measuring devices, ladders, flashlights, stools, clamps (unless they are used for crushing), jacks, beakers, tape recorders(?). Active tools have a tangible effect: drills, pencils, hammers, nail clippers, spatulas, shovels. In general tools act on a material (although not necessarily a specific material, like a flashlight will act on most things): pencils act on paper, egg beaters act on eggs, saws on wood or metal, caulk guns on caulk, paint brushes on paint, beakers on chemicals. So consider a container of correction fluid: the little brush on the inside of the lid is the active tool, the container is the passive tool and the whiteout is the material.

307611359.0,"SDATA_7 :  `== Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode ==NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBefore we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First,statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner(s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12%. Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too ``Blame the Deed NOT the Breed`` which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one's that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors/actresses.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by   •   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I'm adding a request in any case.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack.  There's nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN: A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article.  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article...  Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression, but those wouldn't be true to Human character would they?   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN::Isn't a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia:Images: ``Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article's topic.`` Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0108/485244.html and http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/02/mandatory-confi.html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a ``smiling pit bull`` in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007). We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance.   NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:::A single screenshot image could also be obtained from a television news report about pit bulls and included under fair use.

That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs an example, being Australian I checked his figure for ``Australian Jews`` in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population.

Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENCopyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.NEWLINE_TOKENDuring the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENChams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAs a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book ``Historical Sight Through Thesprotia``, edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that ``The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek`` .NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOn June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENDuring the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed  : EDATA_7",dev,1

I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, ``The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).```  : EDATA_7",dev,0

The scandal here is clearly not the ``hacking incident`` - about which virtually nothing is known.

I have tried to stay away from here since the ANI was closed, but as you continue making accusations and comments about me, I must say that I consider your comments to be personal attacks and I consider the post that Gnangarra linked to in particular to be defamatory and libelous and I feel that you should agree to refactor those comments, and the other personal attacks you made about editors on ANI, as I see has also been previously suggested by Shell as well. The ``do not edit the archive`` notices in the ANI archives are designed to prevent people from continuing discussions in the archives, rather than to prevent people removing defamatory material. You claim that you've been ``slandered`` (actually libeled). I believe everything I have said about you has been absolutely true, however, if I have inadvertently made a mistake and it was pointed out to me, I would redact it. Unfortunately, every time I have interacted with you you have made demonstrably false accusations, accusing me of doing things I had clearly and provably not done at all and so I am rather reluctant to believe that I have posted something factually untrue, but I am quite prepared to go back and re-examine my comments and refactor if I have made a mistake. When you wrote these offensive and defamatory comments about me, I had been deliberately trying to refrain from saying very much on the ANI due to your previous hostile reactions to me and had actually made very few comments, only responding to people who were confused or misunderstood and thus your accusations at that point in time were totally over the top and unfair and did not measure up to the evidence of my posts. Additionally, you are completely anonymous and not known by your real life identity, whereas I have spent most of my time on Wikipedia editing under my full name and am well known and you yourself have even commented about knowing my full name, so I find your comments and accusations defamatory to me in the real world. I feel you should agree to refactor your personal attacks against, not just myself, but others too, and I must therefore support previous requests for you to refactor these personal attacks and false accusations. Please also note that BLP applies to all pages on Wikipedia, not just to articles, Wikipedia:BLP#Non-article_space, and so if you persist in keeping your personal comments about me, a living, known and identifiable person, I must once again for the nth time insist that you provide verifiable proof supporting your allegations and accusations because you are in violation of BLP.

Now that the communist threat is gone, it's no longer necessary to accommodate basic decency in dealing with employees, for example. I have worked on the bottom of the food chain long enough to know how many liberties some employers take with their employees. The irony is, of course, that out of fear of Communism, working conditions in the West were much better than in Communist countries. I still think the masses are cowardly, nasty, stupid, and disgusting in general. But, that's regardless of who they are made up of. Any assembly of people that exceed about a hundred people tends to take on disgusting behaviour. Just watch frat parties at 'elite' universities. Yuck. You don't even need 100 people for that. Humanity as such is vile, it's only redeeming feature is the occasional decent human being. My support for democracy is not based on any kind of sympathy with 'the masses', but it's simply based on the realization that there are no better alternatives.

It was released on the Nintendo GameCube in North America on October 21, 2002 strangely before the Japanese release on November 8, 2002. It was released on November 29, 2002 in Europe, being heavily criticised for being 'Nintendo's big GameCube Game' for Christmas 2002 as Metroid Prime was delayed until March 2003.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENMario Party 4 was the first Mario Party that was released on the Nintendo GameCube. Each board had its own host, including Toad, Goomba, Shy Guy, Koopa, and Boo. Mario Party 4 also contains some characters new to the franchise; Thwomp and Whomp. Klepto, Dolphin, Lakitu, and Star, along with two completely new characters named Genie of the Lamp and Ztar, are included as well. Mario Party 4 retains the Story Mode found in Mario Party 3.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe game, as usual, contains a standard party mode in which up to four players play through a board, trying to collect as many Stars as possible. The Star Space would appear randomly on the board, and players would have to reach it before anyone else. However, the Stars carry a price tag of 20 coins, and player has to earn those coins by winning minigames, which take place at the end of each turn (after all the players have rolled the Dice Block, which will always roll a number from one to ten).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBattle minigames are like the 4-player games, but generally (with many exceptions) a little more elaborate. Battle games are usually tense because every player has to put a certain number of coins (from 5 - 50) into a pot. First place gets 70% of the pot, second place gets 30%, and a random player gets any coins lost in rounding. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENEvery Mario Party contains 60 to 80 minigames of a few different types. Four-player games are a free-for-all in which all players compete against each other. 2-on-2 and 1-on-3 minigames put players in groups, so they have to cooperate in the minigame to win, even though they are against each other in the main game. In most situations, winners of these games make 10 coins each.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENA new addition to the Mario Party series was the Bowser mini-games.

NEWLINE_TOKEN::Nichalp says in the present thread ``The term ``British India`` is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India``. I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about ``popular parlance``, it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the ``popular parlance`` of much of the world, ``Great Britain`` and ``England`` are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.NEWLINE_TOKEN::On Nichalp's suggestion that ``British India`` should be redirected to British Raj``, I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj.

NEWLINE_TOKEN::Fowler&fowler; asks ``Would you be opposed to ``British India`` being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of ``British Raj?`` `` I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed.

I personally couldn't smoke enough tobacco to stay awake sitting through 88 hours of those horror flicks.  To reference another BRIC country: a 2004-05 study showed 89% of all movies made in India contained depictions of ``tobacco use`` (almost always cigarettes).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Trying to remove from Wikipedia cannabis-related articles any information about possible Harm Reduction alternatives to hot burning overdose ``joint`` smoking such as one-hitters, kiseru, midwakh etc. ``joint`` and rolling papers are a handy Industry strategy to get children oriented to cigarette smoking.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Trying to delete information that could serve as a warning against mixing cannabis with tobacco (for example, an edit deleting a reference in the hashish article to an Australian Department of Health study indicating that that practice could lead to unintended nicotine addiction (which is of course what cigarette companies want it to do).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThis may explain why, in May 2010, Mjpresson nominated the One-hitter (smoking) article for deletion (reason: ``It's just a bad article.``) (vote: 4-1 for Keep).  By October 2010, after pictures of midwakh, kiseru etc. were added, the article ranked ninth in Category:Cannabis smoking with 1191 hits a day according to a rating survey.  This week, expecting to win the vote against Tokerdesigner at ANI, Mjpresson has deleted over 50% of the One-hitter (smoking) article, including pictures (all-important!) showing what a one-hitter is.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENAt ANI I have referenced the May 30, 2011 World Health Organization press release claiming that ``tobacco`` (mainly cigarette smoking of course) will kill 6 million human beings in 2011, and scheduled to rise at present rates to 8 million a year by 2030; so if Mjpresson says Tokerdesigner is a ``single-purpose editor`` at least you'll understand why.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENSo again, congratulations for opposing putting a picture of a ``joint`` atop the [[Cannabis (smoking) article (especially without any warning that there may be tobacco mixed into it), but beware, you have doubtless attracted ``their`` attention and Big 2WackGo may be after you.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Note: beware of 3-R's, i.e. by simply reverting mJ'S edit three times you may violate a WP rule aimed at preventing edit wars; better strategy is to change something, add something different with each edit, trying to improve things each time in the interest of a positive solution.  Mj is a stickler for following the rules and will get you for that.  Though I consider him a stooge of the world's leading genocide-for-profit conspiracy I also recognize that Mj is talented and industrious and may do much good someday (after being ``forgiven on grounds of insanity``).NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN* Try to find more pictures (make a JPG file and upload to Wiki Commons, I don't have that technology yet) which show better what a one-hitter is (quarter-inch or 6-mm screened crater for 25-mg single servings, instead of 500 mg in a joint every time you want a smoke! avoiding heat shock and carbon monoxide and dopy ``stoner`` symptoms blamed on cannabis etc.)  Mj objects to the midwakh picture because it is traditionally used for tobacco, not cannabis, but he also deleted it from the one-hitter article where it was clearly described as used for tobacco.  The kiseru picture is a bit indistinct and doesn't show how narrow the crater is.  The major fear of the tobacco industry, even more than cannabis legalization, is the de facto legalization of harm reduction utensils which eliminate the need for high-profit cigarette papers.

I would argue that reference 3 is also misleading as the data models presented there are to simplistic and will mislead people so using you own argument if you exclude reference 5 then you should also exclude reference 3. Energy models are inherently complex beasts and very simple representations such as 3 contribute nothing but confusion to the debate.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``Your complaint about a supposed 'Green rant' indicates that you do not have a neutral view`` - you are reading to much into that comment. Its a response to the fact that the media that I read seems to be full of half baked green ideas which don't add up either from a technical or a mathematical point of view. As a trained engineer I am only interested in arguments that make sense from a technical view not fantasy land arguments that seem to require 1+1 to = something other than 2!NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf you read the comment is fee website where Monobiot writes you will see something like 5 to 7 pages of comment on his article almost all critical about his article.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``But do you not see the difference between marketing spin by AGA, and reliable, referenced data?`` - yes of course - so provide some - I dont think this article cirrently contain any.

NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN``For example, you have plucked a figure of 30 years out of somewhere`` its either in that article or another one on the AGA or Rayburn web sites.

You cant consider thenal devices such as a AGA without considering how they are used. For instance consider 2 AGA , a 2 oven model in a single person household and a 4 Oven model in a nursing home. The first would be a disaster preparing maby only one hot meal a day, while the other would be on the go 24x7x365. Both are AGA, the first setup would be crazy, the second is a market that actually buys large numbers of AGA and they are commercial institutions for the most part, they are run by hard nosed managers and yet they buy tons of AGA why is that if they are as bad as you say? What do you know that all these hard nosed money pinchers don't?

It is made up of a so-called ``volunteer system.``  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further ``editing`` and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a ``terrible person you are.``  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENBelow is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don't serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven't checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don't directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENThe soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of ``vandalism`` by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw ``vandalism`` accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a ``disarming`` strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENNow as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They're three organizations all saying the same thing. What's really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI'm not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As  : EDATA_7",dev,0

As I understand it its a municiple, political difference. City status doesn't automaticly come with size. This is clearer in the UK where there has to be a cathedral, a university and other factors (such as population size), then the Queen grants ``city`` status. Here in the US I think its a little less rigorous, but the State grants the city ``status`` if the town and state desire. I'm not sure what that status brings with it, but its likely to change the way the place is administered / financed and governed. I hope this helps  NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKEN:According to the Vermont Citizens' Guide, (published by the Vermont League of Women Voters), ``The usual connotation of a city as a densely populated urban area is alien to Vermont.  Of the thirty largest local government units, only eight hold city charters and one must continue down the list to the 72nd largest community before reaching the ninth City of Vergennes with a population of 2,741 ...

The name is probably still in use in Africa. Legally, most of our American churches go by ``Apostolic Faith Church,`` with some churches adding the word Trinity to distinguish our organization from others. In regard to Joe Bishop's sermon on Biblical modesty, I thinkI'm fairly certainI know exactly which sermon you're talking about. I thoroughly enjoyed it myself. There are some copies floating around. I know a few people that have them.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENYou're absolutely rightmy age does limit my experience. But I think, to be fair, your experience limits your objectivity. A few people have asked me about this Wikipedia page, and my response to them has been along the lines of ``it doesn't really need that much fixing.`` I'm not interesting in changing the majority of what you've written. The only thing that concerns meNEWLINE_TOKENis the spin, the anti-AF opinion that runs through the factual accounts. Every historian operates through a unique lens of perspective, and the lens you're looking through is tainted by someI imaginevery painful experiences. NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENI've had offers of help, and I've turned them down. Since the only work of note that I have really put into the article amounts to the altering or deletion of about six phrases, I didn't think it would be worth mustering the Apostolic Forces. It's not my place or desire to create an historical account for the world to look at. Perhaps this is laziness excused, but I feel that if the organization was concerned about the encyclopedic content available through Wikipediaand I think that it should besome committee or pastor or minister or historian should get on and take care of it. (Fact is, I'd guess that most of our AF leaders probably aren't aware of just how widely-spread Wikipedia is used, and if they did, they would probably do something about itif someone also told them they were allowed to. We're not exactly on the cutting edge of technology.) I'm sure that whatever I wrote, or however I wrote it, someone somewhere would disagree. Probably many someones. Which is another reason why I've greatly limited my input.NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENIf I asked you to verify all your encyclopedic content, how much information would be left that isn't rooted in undocumentable or unverifiable personal experience? I think large portions would be missing from the ``church doctrines and teachings`` sectionthough I did not delete them, because I know that, while not verifiable or encyclopedic, most of what has been written is factually accurate. Is that what Wikipedia is for, though? Unverifiable facts?NEWLINE_TOKENNEWLINE_TOKENOne last question, about the alteration you made to my alteration regarding dancing.
